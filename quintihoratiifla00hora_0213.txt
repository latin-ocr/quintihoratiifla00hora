ODE VI.

L. Munatius Plancus, a gentleman of fortune and of consular
dignity, had joined the republican party with Brutus and Cassius ς
but aster the defeat of his party at Philippi, he joined Augustus.
He was cordially received, and treated with great respect by Au-
gustus 3 but being afterwards induced by the friends of Antony to
believe, that, with the aid of Cleopatra, the republicans might. still
be successful, he went over to Antony. He found, however, that
things were less favorable than they had been represented, and
returned again to the ruling party. Aster this he was not very
cordially received by Augustus. And feeling that he did not stand
well at court, he retired to his country seat at Tibur. Here, prob·
ably under some apprehensions for his safety, Plancus became
melancholy and unhappy. Horace, his friend, writes this ode to
him 3 offering such reasons as his ingenuity suggested,lto induce
him to abandon his ill bodingS‚ and become cheerful, A socia]
glass with his old friends, he says, will do much towards removing
his melancholy.

their temples vwith the olive wreaths gathered from thence 3 or in

celebrated ‘in honor of J uno,’ because she was particularly wor-
shipped in these cities.

10. Patiens: this epithet israpplied to Lacedaemon in allusion
to the severity of discipline to which its inhabitants submitted,
and to the rigor of its laws.

11. Percussit.- ‘has charmed.' The poet means to say3 aster
all, none of these places have so much delighted me, as your de·
lightful residence at Tibur, near the fountain of Albunea, where·
the cascadeS‚ the groves, the melody of birds, and a pure atmos-

phere, unite their ctha-rms.
