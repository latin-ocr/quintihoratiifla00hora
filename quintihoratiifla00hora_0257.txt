ODE XII.

AElius Lamias, to whom this ode was addressed, was a person
of illustrioris family and considerable estate. He had risen by his
personal merit to the rank of lieutenant-general in the Spanish
war under Augustus. He so demeaned himself in this o'ffice as to
gain the esteem and respect of the army. Horace therefore com-
pliments him on the hereditary honors, which he so well sustain-
ed 3 and upon which his own character and achievements had shed
additional lustre. And since he predicts a storm on the morrOW,
he invites Lamias to pass the day with him. v

illo auctore, qui princeps dicitur incoluisse maeuia Formiarum, et
late tyrannus tenuisse Lirim innantem littoribus Maricae.

2. Hinc: i. e. α Lamo ,- from this Lamuspking of the Laestrygo-
neS, the former Lamiae derived their name.

4. Fastos: these were the registers or anneus, in which was
kept the record of the family of the Lamiae, as well as that of oth-
er noble families, and of public affairs.

7. Et innantem . . . Lirim .· i. e. and held under his sway the
river Liris, which flows into the sea through the marshes of Min-
turnae. “ Ager Minturnensis designatur per fluvium Lirim, qui il-
lum transit, et per paludes Minturnenses in mare diffunditur?
Doer.—Maricae .· Marica was a nymph, the wife of Faunus, and '³
mother of Latinus, who presided over Minturnae, and the regions
about it; hence littoribus Maricae, for ‘ the marshes of Mintusnae ’
