THE SECULAR POEM.

Tffls poem, designed to be sung at the celebration ofthe Secu-
lar Games, by a choir of fifty-four boys and girls, an equal number
of each, is considered one of the most finished performances of
antiquity. These games were celebrated once in an age, or
about a hundred years. They were instituted in consequence of
certain prophecies contained in the Sibylline Books. This 'cele-
bration was originally distinguished by three solemn festivals, which
were afterwards united in one festival, which continued three days
and three nights successively. The first celebration of the Secu-
lar Games was in the year of Rome 2453 the second was in 3053
the third was in 5053 the fourth was in 6053 and the fisth, for
which Horace wrote this poem, was in 737. It was therefore a
hundred and thirty-two years since the last celebration. The
present solemnities were announced with great pomp and pre par-
ation. The heralds were sent out into the provinces to invite all

the- world to a fegtlival, such as they never had seen, and never.
