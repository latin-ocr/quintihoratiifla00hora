his son Mystes, he gave himself up to grief, and spent his time in
writing elegies, and in other expressions of sorrOW.

by saying that it was contrary to nature, where storms and winter
do not always reign 3 and that others had been afflicted in a simi-
lar manner, who yet did not sink under their bereavements. Be-
sides, he might better employ his talents in celebrating the praises
of Au ustus.

mournful elegies your lost Mystes.’
