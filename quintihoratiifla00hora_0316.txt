SATIRE TV.

This satire consists of an amusing dialogue between the poet
and one Catius, who pretends to 113 3 great philosopher, and also
to be profoundly versed in the science of cookery. But he be-
comes ridiculous by attaching so much importance to what is of
little consequence3 and more particularly by exposing his utter
ignorance of the subject on which he discourses. The whole is
akeen satire upon that class of men who place their supreme
happiness in the pleasures of the table. This he considers an
abuse of Epicureanism, in the refined forms of which he was him-
self a believer.

12. Longa . . . erit: ‘·to such eggs as shall have a long ap·

the first dish of the first course, and proceeds to the second
course, or the fruit. The following precepts, given by Catius, are
