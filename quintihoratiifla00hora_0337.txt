EPISTLE XIX.

This epistle is a satire on the poets of our author’s time, who,
under pretence that Bacchus was the god of poetry, and that the
best ancient bards loved wine, imagined they might equal their
merit by drinking as freely. Horace laughs at such ridiculous
imitation, and rallies the methodical dullness of their compositione.
Dacier.

1. Cratino .· Cratinus was excessively fond of wine3 so much
so, that Aristophanes sayS, he died of grief at seeing a hogshead
broken and the wine running out.

5. Fere .· i. e. plerumque.
8. Forum . . . severis .· ‘let the forum and the praetor's court,

established by Libo, be the lot of the sober 3 but I forbid them to
attempt poetry 3' i. e. let serious business be performed by the
temperate. The praetor's court was near the puteal. This we
understand to be the decree of Bacchus,

15. Rupit Iarbitam.- the poet means to say that Iar-bita burst
with envy and vexation in attempting to rival the wit and elo-
quence of Timagenes the rhetorician.
