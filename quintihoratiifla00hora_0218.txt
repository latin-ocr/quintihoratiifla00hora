not invincible. The poet’s meaning is, that the glory of the an·-
cient Marcellus, far from being tarnished by the lapse of time,
gains new lustre in one of his descendants (i. e. the nephew of
‘Augustus), and, as a young shoot from an old stock, it rises by in-
sensible degrees to its full strength and proportions.

47. Julium sidus: This undoubtedly refers to the young Mar-
cellus, then scarce seventeen years old, whose bright and opening
virtues already reflected glory on the Julian family, and not, as
some have supposed, to Julius Caesar. This young Marcellus, it
will be recollectcd‚ was the son of Octavia, the sister of Augustus,
who had adopted nim as his successor3 and the youth to whom
Virgil applied those beautiful and toucliing lines in AEn. vi. 882,
886. Doering thus explains it: “inter omnes, sc. alios Romanorum
juvenes, Jaliam sidus .· juvenis MarcelluS, sideris instar virtutum
suarum splendore gentem suam Juliam illustrans, spes ac decus

entis J uliae.'’
g 50. Tibi cura . . . regnes .· ‘to you, O Jove, has the guidance of
great Augustus been committed by the Fates: so reign, Ι beseech
μου, that his empire may be second to yourS.' That is, as express-
ed in verses 57 and 58, may you rule in heaven, and he upon the
earth.

55. Subjectos Orientis 0⁷·ae .· ‘ dwelling in the extreme borders of
the East.' .

56. Seras et Indos.- ‘the Serae and Indians,’ the most remote
nations of Asia.

ODE XII.

When the Romam, aster all their sufferings and privations by
the civil wars, were nevertheless concerting measures for a renew-
al of them, Horace addresses them, or rather the commonwealth,
under the figure of a vessel, which, although shattered and dis-
mantled, was preparing to trust itself again to an unknown and
dangerous sea. The allegory is continued with much force and
beauty throughout the ode, by which he endeavors to dissuade
his fellow citizens from their dangerous enterprise, and to induce
them to make sure of the blessings of peace, which were offered
under the governinent of Augustus. ,

1. „Vovifluchw .· i. e. ‘ new waves' of civil dissension.

3. Portum: this harbor means the peace offered by Augus-
tus.

4. Nudumremigio latus .· the force of the republican party was
greatly diminished by the loss of several of the principal leaders3
they had been defeated at Philippi; Sextus Pompeius had fled3
and others were despondent.

9. Lintea .· i. e. the sails, which were rent.

10. Di .· i. e. the tutelary godS, whose images were usually pla·
ced on the stem of the ship, he sayS, had forsaken her. 'l'heir
i'mages were broken and washed away.
