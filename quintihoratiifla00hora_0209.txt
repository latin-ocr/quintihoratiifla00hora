ian threshing-floors.’ Lybia was a part of Africa particularly fer· ⁴

tile in rain.

12. &italicis conditionibus : ‘by the wealth of Attalus ς’ who was

made the commonwealth of Rome his heir.

13. N‘zmquam dimoveas .· ‘you can never induce.’-Trabe Cy-

prus was at that time so distinguished for its commerce.

29. &Me .· Wakefield and some others think that the whole ten-

the most eminent of the lyric poets, and some others, belonged to
Lesbos, .

For an explanation of the kind of verse used in this and the sub-
sequent odes, the student is referred to the metrica] key.
