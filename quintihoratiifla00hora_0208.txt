ODE 1.

Tms ode is supposed to have been written by Horace, aster the
completion of some of his works, as a dedication of them to Maece-
mm, his patron and friend. The poet describes with much felicity
the different views of men with respect to happiness, and portrays
some of their ruling passions. In conclusion, he compliments
Maecenas on his taste for the fine arts‚ and his love of learning, by
intimating that he shall not consider his own claims to rank with
the lyric poets established, without the sanction of his judgment.

cenas, so long distinguished as the favorite of Augustus, and still
more so for the protection and encouragement which he afforded

kings of Etruria or Tuscany. To him, says Mr. Sanadon, the pres-
ent world is in a great measure indebted for all the wit and learn-
ing of the Augustan age 3 and even at this day the name of Maece-
nas is a title not unworthy of persons of the noblest character, who
knOW, like him, how to animate the spirit of emulation among wri-
ters by their favor and generosity.

2. Ο et praesidium .· with much propriety Horace addresses him
as his guardian and delightful honor3 since Maecenas not only
procured his pardon from Augustus, for fighting against him with
Brutus and the republicans at Philippi, but even brought him into
peculiar favor with that illustrioris personage. a

8. Τ ἠὼ tollere honoribus: ‘to raise him to the highest
honor-s!— esword tergeminis is probably used in reference to
the threehighest grades of office among the Romans, viz. the aedile-
ship, the praetorship, and the consulshi -
