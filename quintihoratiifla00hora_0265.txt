ODE Ι.

AUGUSTUS had been in Gaul, where he had put a stop to the
progress of the Sicambri, and confirmed the conquests of Tiberius
and Drusus over the Rhaeti and Vindelici. His return was expect-
ed with much impatience at Rome, where a magnificent triumph
was preparing for him. On this occasion Antonius Julius, then
praetor of the city, requested Horace to write a Pindaric ode in
honor of Augustus, Our poet confesses himself unequal to the
task, and tells Antonius that he can much better perform it him-
se1f3 while at the same time, as his commentators say, he surpass-
ed even Pindar.

3. Daturus nomina .· it will be recollected that Icarus, the son
of Daedalus, is said to have given a name to the Icarian Sea by
being drowned in it. He fiew too high, and the sun melted the
wax with which his wings were constructed, and he fell into that
part of the Archipelago which bears his name.

7. Prosundo . . . ore .· i. e. with deep and majestic eloquence.

10. Nova . . . verba .· although writers of dithyrambic poetry
were not restrained by the ordinary laws of number and measure,
and gave way to a daring irregularity not allowed to any other
form of writing3 yet they had no right to coin ‘new words? But
they made new combinations3 and nova verba probably meam

compound ννοτᾶερἑἓῖ so used before.
