ODE XIV.

Palinodia signifies a ‘recantation,' or the retracting of what has
been said. It seemS, our poet, having been supplanted by a more
successful competitor for the favor of Tyndaris, the daughter of
Gratidia, wrote an abusive and scurrilous ode to her. He now
wishes to retract what he had done, and to re‘iiistate himself in the
favor of TyndariS, to whom he was much attached. He pleadS,
as his excuse, the influence of irresistible passion, and denies ever
having indulged the feelings expressed in his former ode.

1. Matre pulchre} .· The former ode is said to have begun thus:

Ο matre turpifilia turpior l

2. Quem . . . Hadriam) .· Quem cunque is divided by tmesis.
‘ You will destroy‚ in any way you please, my slanderous Iambics3
whether you see fit to throw them into the fire, or into the Adriatic
sea!

5. Dindymene .· i. e. Cybele, so called from Dindymus, or Din-
dgrinis, a mountain in Phrygia consecrated to her service and wor-
s ip. ,
11. Tremendo . . . tumultu .· ‘ with his dread thunderbolts.’

13. Fertur Prometheus . . . desectam .· i. e. Prometheus, when, on
account of the failure of his materials‚ which were exhausted in
making other animals, he was compelled to blend in the first form-
ed man a particle (undique desectam) taken from every other ani-
mal, is said also to have placed in our breast something of the fury
of the raging lion. ’

Therefore‚ the poet would argue, he may justly hope for pardon
for an act proceeding from an infirmity of human nature.

17. Thyesten: the dreadful effects of passion may be learned
from the story of Thyestes. See Class. Dict.

22. Pectoris . . ,servor .· ⁴ furious anger.'

25. Nunc ego . . . tristia: how far Horace succeeded in regainr
ikpg the favor of Tyndaris, we learn from the following ode to

ODE XV.

Horace, having reinstated himself in the favor of Tyndaris, in-
vites her to his country-seat, where he offers her retirement and a
cool retreat from the heat of dog-days.

1. Lucretilem mutat Lycoeo Faunus: by hypallage, for mutat
Dycoeum Lucretili. Horace's country-seat was near the foot of
mount Lucretilis, which, he sayS, Faunus finds so pleasant that he
osten forsakes his Arcadian mountain Lycaeus, and comes to visit
it. He considers himself under the protection of that god, who
defends his goats from the extremes of the weather.

4. Usque.- i. e. semper-,- ‘always’

7. Olentis uxores mariti .- i. e. the she-goats.
