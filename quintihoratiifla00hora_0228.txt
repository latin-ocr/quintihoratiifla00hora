17. Frui paratis . . . mente .· ‘ grant, Ο Son of Latona, I pray you,
that I may e‘njoy the blessings already acquired, both in health and
with a mind unimpaired.’-—Paratis, i. e. what I now possess—La·

ODE XXVII.

It seems that, on some occasion of more than ordinary impor-
tance, Horace was requested to write 3 whether by AugustuS, Mae-
cenas, or some other person, it does not appear. But the poet ad-
dresses his lyre in a manner calculated to show that he feels the
responsibility of the undertaking.

1. Poscimur .· ‘ our efforts are demanded3’ i. e. I am put in re- ·
quisition, my services are required3 and if, when at ease, I have
ever sung with you any thing deserving to live for a year or more
—-come nOW, O my lyre, first turned by Lesbian Alcaeus, and

6. Qui ferox bello ι Alcaeus was no less distinguished as a gene-

ode he acknowledges his error in living, as he had, a life of sensu-
ality, and in neglecting the duties of religion and the worship of
the godS. Some have doubted his sincerity. Be that as it may,
he rejects the folly of the Epicureans, who deny an overruling
power, and account for all the phenomena of nature independent-
ly of any such power.

2. Insanieutis . . . erro.- ‘while imbued with the principles of
mad philosophy, I wander from the way!

5. Namque Diespiter .· the poet gives a reason for disbelieving
the Epicureans 3 that he lately heard Jove thundering in a serene and
cloudless sky3 whereas thunder usually, plerumque, proceeds srom
