a. married man. This ode was written in consequence, in which
Horace informs him of the reason, and invites him to be present
at the entertainment. · “ ,

1. Martiis . . . linguae: the construction is, O Maecenas, docte
sermones utriusque lingum, miraris quid ego coelebs agam kalendis
Martiis, qaidflores velint, et acerra plena thuris, carboque positas in
vivo ces ite.

5. Dffcte . . . lingua: .· ‘learned in both Greek and Latin? This
means no more than a complimentary salutation3 as vir eruditis-
sime. .

7. Libero .- the poet here ascribes his preservation to Bacchus 3
whereas, in Book II. Ode XIV. 28, he attributes the same kind
office to Faunus. As both these divinities were supposed to have
poets under their protection, Dacier thinks it may be the same god
under different names3 and that a goat was offered to him under
the name of Bacchus, and a sheep when he was called Faunus.

11. Institutae .· i. e. coeptae.

13. Amici sospitis .· se. in gratiam ,- i. e. ob amicum sospitem.

15. Perfer in lacem .· ‘continue till daybreak)

17. Mitte civiles: Maecenas, in the absence of Augustus, had
the government of Rome.

18. Daci Cotisonis .· Conso was king of the Daci, or Getae.
He had made inroads into the Roman territory3 but was repulsed
b Lentulus.

γ21. Servit . . . Cantaber .· the war in Spain continued more than
two hundred years before the Cantabrians were perfectly sub-
dued.

25. Negligens . . . cavere.- ‘relaxing your anxiety, since you
are a private man, do not be too solicitous about public concerns.'
——Privatus .· although Maecenas was praefect of Rome, yet, as com-
pared with the emperor, he is properly called a private man. Oth-
ers understand it thus: ‘ Divest yourself of your public character,
and assume that of a private citizen for the present occasion.’

ODE VIII.

Horace had formed an attachment to Lyde, who, being young
and a stranger to love, paid little regard to his professions. The
poet therefore addresses this ode to Mercury, entreating him to
inspire a song, the strains of which may make an impression on
the obdurate fair one. And we gather from the XXII. Ode of
this Book that he did not write in vain.

1. Te . . . magistro: ‘ under your instruction.'

5. Nec loquax olim.- before Mercury conceived the plan of

fplnrliling the lyre, no music was made upon the testudo or tormine
s e .

9. Ta pote-5 . . . silvas .· this alludes to the fable of Orpheus.
17. Rtyos: or Tityus,- the Greek termination is in os.
