ODE VII.

Licinius Varro Murena, the brother of Proculeius Varro Mure-
na, mentioned in Ode II. 5. of this Book, for his parent-al affection
and generosity towards his brothers, was a young man of a restless,
ardent, and ambitious spirit. Horace, knowing his character, and
wishing to preserve him from the evils to which his fearless and
aspiring views exposed him, addressed this ode to him, contain-
ing much sound wisdom, and some excellent rules and maxims for
life. But Licinius could not be governed by them. Having been
detected in forming a conspiracy against Augustus, he suffered
the fatal consequences of his rashness. For all the interest which
his brother Proculeius and Maecenas, who married his sister Te-
rentia, were able to exert, could not save him.

13. Sperat infestis .· sc. rebus ,· ‘in adversity hopes?

17. Νοη . . . sic erit .- ‘if things go wrong nom it will not be so
hereafter.'

ODE VIII.

Quinctius Hirpinus ,was a man of great wealth, and of an anx-
ious and timid character. He made himself unhappy by dreading
changes and civil commotionS, which might endanger his posses-
sions. Horace offers to him, in this beautiful ode, the same kind
of consolation which he frequently gives to others in trouble. He
exhorts them not to be anxious about futurity3 since life is too
short to have any portion of it wasted in unavailing anxieties. Old
age and infirmities will soon deprive them of the power of enjoy-
ing the blessings they possess. He recommends, therefore, that
they should make the most of present enjoyments, without troub
ling their thoughts about the things beyond their reach or con-
trol.

1. Cantaber, et Scythes . . . cogitet .· i. e. what plans the warlike
Cantabrian and Scythian may be forming. .

9. Non semper idem floribus .· few things are lcss durable th
the flowers of spring, or more changeable than the moon; and yet
these are images of human life, most strikingly true and. impres-
slve.

11. ,Minoremx i. e. unable to comprehend.
17. Ευία3 .- Βέῧοὴυε.
