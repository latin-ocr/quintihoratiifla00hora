ODE XVII.

Phidyle was a rustic woman, and, as most commentators sup-
pose, the poet’s house-klceper in the country. She seems to have
imbibed the opinion that sacrifices to the gods were morc or less
acceptable in proportion to their intrinsic value. Horace in this
ode attempts to convince her, that the gods regarded the disposi-
tion of mind with which sacrifices were offered, rather than the
costliness of the gists 3 that purity of life and good intentions were
of most importance3 and that with these, any offerings, however
small, were acceptable.

1. Supinas: when the ancients prayed to the celestia] gods,
they raised their hands ‘with the palms upwards3’ but turned
them downwards when they addressed the infernal gods,

2. Naso-ente Lami .· the occasions were very numerous on which
it was supposed proper to make sacrifices to the gods3 Horace
would imply that once a month, ‘ at the new moon‚’ was sufficient,
and then it was ‚not necessary to be extravagant.

3. Hormi : i. e. proesentis anni. Adj. hornus, —a‚ -ῑιτη,

7. Dulces alumni: i. e. rigni, hredi ‚· sc. sentient.

9. Nam, quoe . . . tinget: the construction is, N'am victima diis
devota, quae pascitur nivali Algido inter quercus el ilices, aut crescit
in Albanis herbis, tinget cervice secures pontifi-cum. The meaning
is, that these victims are designed sor public sacrifices, which may
with propriety be more magnificent than those of private individu-
als, who ought to make their offerings proportionate to their sta·
tion and abilities.

15. Parvos . . . myrto .· ‘crowning your little household gods
with rosemary and tender myrtle.’ This is enough. You need
not attempt to appease them by the slaughter of many victims.

17. Immanis .· sc. sederis,- i. e. ‘pure.’

18. Νοπ sumptuosci . . . micci : ‘it has appeased the angry gods
with pious mea] and crackling salt, and would not have been more
acceptable with a costly sacrifice?

01 »E XVIII.

In this ode Horace inveighs against luxury and extravagance
as the prevailing vices of the age. The ode may be considered
as consisting of three parts. In the first, the poet exposes the
licentious enormities of the age3 in the second, he shows their
causes 3 and in the third, points out their proper remedies.

1. Intactis . . . caput .- the construction is, Dicet occupes omne
Tyrrhenum et Apulicum mare tuis caementis, opulentior intactis the-
sauris Arabum et divitis Indice, tamen si dira Mcessitas figit ada-
mantinos clavos summis verticibus, non expedies animum metu, nec
caput laqueis mortis.»1ntactis .· i. e. “ nondum attrectatis; inte·
