ODE IX.

Α This is a hymn to Mercury‚ supposed to have been written for
*one of his festivals. There seems to be nothing remarkable in it,
except its peculiar clegance of expression, and its great sweetness
’ and harmony of numbers. It is devoted to the praises ofMercury,
and repeats his titles, and exalts his services. He is represented
as fashioning the first race of men, and cultivating their under-
standings by the study of the arts and sciences 3 while he forms
their bodies to grace and strength by the exercises of the paloes·

of his son Hector, unseen by the sentinels and every other person,
till he arrived at the tent of Achilles.

Ilios in the feminine.

ODE X.

Leuconoe is probably a fictitious name, under which some favor-
ite of the poet is addressed. He entreats her to avoid the foolish
and wicked custom, which at that time prevailed at Rome, of con-

1. Τιι ηε qucesieris .· ‘ do not attempt to discover?

2. Ν(- Babylonios . . . numeros .- ‘ nor try the Babyloniam num-
