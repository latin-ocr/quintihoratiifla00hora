ellers and stranger8‚ but drops his cowardly ears and runs, if a
wolf appearS, or if there is need of his aid.- It is frequently pub-

scribed by Horace himself with the real name.

EPODE VII.

This epode was addressed to the Roman people at the time

EPODE VIII.

Previous to the general engagement at Actium, there had been
several partial engagements between the forces of Augustus and
Antony, in which fortune favored the former. Horace, therefore,
on hearing of that great battle, which he expected would prove
decisive, addressed this epode to his patron Maecenas, then at the
scene of action, in anticipation of the glorious result he predicted
to his friend.

mand of the sea, called himself the son of Neptune.
