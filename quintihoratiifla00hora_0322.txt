SATIRE VIII.

Nasidienus, an ostentatione, but miserly knight, gave an en-
tertainment to Maecenas, of which this satire contains a humor-
ous account, related by Fundanius, one of the guestS.

1. Ut. . . beati.- ‘how did the supper of wealthy Nasidienus
please you ?’

2. Nam. . . die.- ‘for when I sent requesting your company
at my table, you were said to be there drinking from noon.’

they dined at an earlier hour than was customary.

which was the place of honor, were Maecenas and his two friends
that he brought with him, umbrae, Vibidius and Balatro. On the
third were Nomentanus, the host Nasidienus ipse, and Porcius.
