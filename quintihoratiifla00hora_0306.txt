SATIRE Ι.

This satire contains a dialogue between Horace and Trebatius,
an eminent counsellor and a distinguished scholar. The poet
asks the advice of Trebatius, who counsels him to give up the
writing of satires, as calculated to render him odious3 and to
celebrate the achievements of Augustus. Horace refuses to follow
his advice, saying that he was not qualified for so high a subject3
but that he must write something, and as he liked satire, and as
no one had any right to be displeased with him for satirizing
vices, if he lived correctly himself, he should go on writing in
this wa . -

Such a piece was called tabella votiva. .

34. Sequor hune .· by a satirical imitation of Lucilius, who offfin
digressed into remarks about himself, Horace here gives an ac-
count of his own extraction.
