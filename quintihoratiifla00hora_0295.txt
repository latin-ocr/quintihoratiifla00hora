SATIRES. BocK I. 287

built upon an abrupt, rocky eminence, overhanging a bay of the
Mediterranean sea. The modern town of Terracina is partly on
the declivity, and extends quite to the water’s edge. Itis near
the extremity of the Pontine marshes towards Naples, and is the
first stopping place after passing twenty—five miles through that
dreary and unwholesome region.

29. Soliti componere .· this was the second conference at Brun-
dusium to reconcile Augustus and Antony.

30. Collym’a .- ‘eye-salve.’—Lippus .· ‘having sore eyes!

32. Ad ranguem . . . homo : ‘ a man made to perfectiori ς’ a figure
taken from artists, working in marblc, who were in the habit of
passing the nail over the marble to ascertain whether it was per-
fectly polished. In our own idiom, ⁶ a perfect gentleman.'

34. Fundos: ⁶ Fundi,’ where Aufidius Luscus acted as praetor.
It seems he was a scribe, and had been sent to fundi, by the
praetor urbanas, to oversee the affairs of it. His vanity indu-:ed
him to make a display before strangers of all the insignia of the
office of praetor at Rome, and rendered him an object of their
ridicule.

35. Insani. . . scribae .· ‘laughing at the display of badges by
this foolish scrivener.'—Praemia .· 1. e. iusignia diguitatis.

36. Prunaeque batillum : ‘ and a censor of burning eoals.’ This
was usually carried before persons vested with supreme authority.

37. Mamurrarum urbe .· i. e. Formicc5 now Mola di Gaeta. Cice-
ro’s favorite country residence was here ς and it was near this place
that the orator was overtaken and slain by the emissaries of An-
tony. There is by the road side, now standing and in good pres-
ervation (in 1830‚) a tower called ‘⁶ the Ceuotaph os Cicero,'' which
is supposed to stand on the spot where he was assassinated. The
bay winds up to Mola, from which is a fine view of Gaeta, at five
miles distance, which, according to tradition, was founded by
AEneas, in honor of the nurse Caieta. Our poet calls Formiae,
,Mamurrarum urbs, from one Mamurra, of obscure origin at Formiae,
who rose to great wealth and influence, and owned much of the
territory. The road from Rome to Naples passes through Mola.

compare any thing to a pleasant friend.’

pointed to furnish hay, wood, and other necessarias for those who
travelled on public business.

51. Quae . . . cauponas .· ‘which is beyond the inns of Caudium)

54. Messi, &cs the construction is, Osci sunt clarum genus
Messi. The Osci, or Campanians near Capua, were notorious for
their vices 3 hence clarum is used ironically.

55. Sarmenti . . . exstat: ‘the mistress of Sarmentus is yet liv-
ing· ς’ 1. e. he is a runaway slave.
