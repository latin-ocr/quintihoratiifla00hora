him in the path of virtue, and instilled those principles into his
mind which seem to have laid the foundation of his happiness.

1. Non quia . . . natum .· the construction is, O Maecenas, non
suspendis adunco naso, ut plerique solent, ignotos, ut me notiam,
libertino patre, quia nemo Lydorum, quidquid Lydorum incoluit
Etruscos fines, est generosior te, nec qzcodfuit tibi maternus atque pa-
ternus avus, qui olim imperitarent magnis legionibus.—-Lydorum ⁴
. . .fines: ‘of all the Lydians that ever settled in the Etrurian
territorieS.⁹ It was the common belief that the first settlers of
Etruria were from Lydia. The poet means to say, O Maecenas,
though yourself of the noblest origin, both on your father's and
your mother’s side, you do not, like most men of high extraction,
look with contempt upon persons of obscure birth.

5. N'on naso suspendis adunco .· ‘you do not sneer at.)

6. [libertino .· libertinus originally meant the son of a freedman3
but afterwards both libertus rand libertinus were used to signify a
sreedman.

9. Ignobile .· because Servius Tullius was born of a female
slave. And yet by his own merits he rose to sovereignty.

12. Contra, Loevinum . . . populo .· ⁶ whereas, on the contrary,
that Laevinus, though belonging to the family of Valerius Poplicola,
who helped to banish Tarquin the Proud from his kingdom, was
never valued at more than one penny, even by the Roman people,
whose humor you know!

14. Licuisse .· i. e. aestimatum esse. Dicere was a word used at
auctions 3 as, parvo pretio lieet (sc. habere rem), ‘ the thing is
cheap 3’ and is, no doubt, here used in its original sense. -

20. Quam Decio . . . novo: i. e. than to a man like Decius, who
had risen by his own meritS. Moveret .- ‘ would exclude me,’ from
the senate.

22. Pelle .· i. e. sorte, or conditione.

24. Non minias . . . generosis: ‘no less the ignoble than the
hi h-born.’

ἓ24. Quo tibi . . . tribuno .· se. profuit5 ‘What did it profit yon,
Tullius, to resume the laticlave you had put off, and become tri-
bune ?'—Tribuno, for tribunum, by attraction agreeing with tibi,
aster the manner of the Greeks. This Tullius was of low birth,
and had been compelled to relinquish the laticlave by Caesar, be-
cause he espoused the cause of Pompey3 bu} aster the death of
Caesar he resumed it.

27. Ut quisque . . . pellibus .· ‘ when any one is so crazy as to
cover half his leg with black leather.’ The buskins worn by sen-
ators were originally black.

30. Barrus.- a vain, conceited spendthrif't, ‘who wished to bc
thought handsome.

38. Pane . . . audes .· ‘dare you, the son of a Syrus, a Damas,

’ or a Dionysius ?’ These are the names of slaves.-—E saxo .-

⁶ down from theQss-arpeian rock.'
