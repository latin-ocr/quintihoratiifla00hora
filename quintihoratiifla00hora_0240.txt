ODE XI.

The shortness of life and the inevitable event of death are very
feelingly set forth in this ode. But the argument and the infer-
ence are, as usual with our poet, employed to enforce the doctrine
of a refined Epicureanism. Had the light of revelation been shed
on his mind, he would not only have considered the shortness of
life as a reason for enjoying it as it passed, which is indeed good
philosophy3 but he would also have urged the necessity of form-
ing the character for a higher and a nobler existence. ¹

Who the person waS, that is here addressed by the name of
Posthumus, or Postumus, as some say it should be written, has
not been ascertained. But it appears to have been a friend
whom Horace considered too parsimonious, and advises to a more
liberal enjoyment of his fortune. ’

5. Non, si . . . enavigandci: the construction is, Non afferet
moram, amice, si quotquot dies eunt, places illacrymabilcm Plutona
trecenis tauris3 Plutona qui compescit ter avnfflum Geryonen Tity- .
(mque tristi undci, scilicet enavigandd omnibus quicunque vescimur
munere terrae.

23. Invisus.- ‘ forbidding‚' ‘mournfut’ The cypress was sacred
to Pluto and Proserpine, and it was usually placed on the funeral
pile with the dead body. It was also placed before the door
where there was any one dead within.

24. Brevem .· ‘short-lived?

28. Pontificum potiore coenis: ‘more delicious than that used at
the suppers of the pontiffs!

ODE XII.

In this ode Horace contrasts the magnificence of the Romans
of his time, in their buildings, plantationS‚ gaudens, and pleasure
grounds, with the frugality of their ancestors3 who considered the
public edifices, and the temples of the godS, the noblest monu-
ments of real grandem, as wel] as of piety.

1. Jam: ‘shortly,’ ‘soon.'—chiae moles : ‘the princely edifices)

4. Stagna : ‘fish-ponds.’ By these the poet probably means
large portions of salt water enclosed from the sea by artificial piers
and dykes.—Platanus.· ‘ the plane tree’ was planted for ornament
only 3 whereas the elm was useful for the vines to run upon.

6. Et omn-is . . . nar-ium .· ‘ and the whole tribe ofsweet-scented
flowers!

8. fertilibus . . . priori .- ‘ which were formerly profitable to their
owner.’

9. Tum .- ‘soon ς’ i. e. the laurel will be made to grow so thick,
‘for the comfort of those walking, that the rays of the sun will be
excludcd from the ground.
