ODE XVII.

Horace hele predicts the glory and immortality of his name.
And, with the true spirit of a poet, he imagines himself already as-
suming the form and faculties of a swan, and soaring above the
earth, over which he is about to take his aerial flight. As he will
leave the humble abodes of men, so he will shake off“thjs mortal
coil,” and cease to be an object of human sympathy or sorrow,
He wishes not for the empty honors of a burial, nor the waste of
useless tears on his account, since he shall not die.

thus 3 non ego, quem vocas, Diceae Maecenas, obibo .· and gives this
explanation: “non ego, ut homo vulgaris, qualem tu me nunc ap-

insu„
