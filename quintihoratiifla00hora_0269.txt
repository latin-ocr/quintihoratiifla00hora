ODE VI.

In this beautiful ode the poet does not merely describe the
pleasures and charms of Spring. His object seems to be to in-
culcate a moral lesson. He would show by the rapid succession
of the seasons, and the deeay of all things in the vegetable king-
dom, that man himself is rapidly passing away3 and that whatever
he has to do in this life must be done quickly.

3. Mutat terra vices .· ‘the earth changes its appearance.’-—Ri-
pas . . . proetereunt : ‘flow within their banks.' The streams, that
had, from the melting of snow and from the rame, overflowed their
banks, have now subsided.

7. Et almum . . . diem: ‘and the hour which hurries off the
grateful day.’

13. Damna . . . lunae .· ‘but the quickly gliding months repair
the losses made by the changing seasons.’ The ancients counted
their months by the new moons3 hence lunae, for memes.
