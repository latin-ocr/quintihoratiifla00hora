SATIRE X.

Lucilius had numerous admirers in Rome, who were greatly
disobliged by the freedom and severity with which he was treat-
ed in the fourth satire of this book. Horace was determined to
support his own judgment3 and, instead of making an apology,
justifies with all his strength what he before had said.
