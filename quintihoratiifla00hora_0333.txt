guest ofhumble condition, perhaps from the country, who, being
invited to an entertainment by a more wealthy individual of the'
same tribe, proceeds thither barefoot, with his slippers and cap un-
der his arm. He carries his slippers or sandals, that they may be
clean when he enters the house of his kinsman, and his cap, as is
usually supposed, to wear home in case of rain, or to protect his
head from the dampness of the night.

EPISTLE XIV.

This epistle is addressed by Horace to his steward in the coun-
try, showing him the folly of preferring a life in the city to one in
the country. He says this preference arises from inconstancy of
mind, and a love of change. For this steward had been transfer-
red, at his own earnest request, from Rome to his present situa-
- tion.

public affairs. Some commentators understand by patres, heads of
families who went to Varia occasionally about their own affairs.
