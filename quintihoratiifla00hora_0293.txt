51. „Vumquid Pomponius .- Horace does not admit the fact, that
in comedy the style is occasionally elevated by the subject, to be

mon rose.

54.p Quem si . . . pater .· so. versum ,· 4 which if you displace,

real poetry or not.

when heated with wine.’

90. Infesto nigris .· ‘ so hostile to slanderers?

98. Sed tamen . . . fleg-erit: 4 and yet I wonder how he got clear
