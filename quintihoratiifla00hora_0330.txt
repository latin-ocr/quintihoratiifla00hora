EPISTLE VIII.

This epistle ιε addressed to Celsus AlbinovanUS, the secretary
of Tiberius, who is mentioned Book Ι. Ep. III. 15. Horace de-
scribes himself as laboring under hypochondriac affections, incon·
stant, contradictory, and unreasonable.

1. Celso . . . Neronis .· the construction is, O Musa rogata, refer
Celso Albinovano, comiti scribaeque Neronis, gaudere et gerere
rem bene. This is an imitation of the Greek form of salutation,
χαίρειν καὶ ednothum-s ‘give joy and success.'

3. Minantem .· ‘ promising,' ‘intending’

10. C'ur . . . veterno.- ‘because they strive to rouse me from
this fatal lothar-gy) Cur is equivalent to ideo, quod. Doer.

12. Ventosus .· ⁶ inconstant‚’ ‘ changeful.’

13. Rem gerat: ut scriba apud N'eronem.

14. Ut placeat juveni .· ‘how lie stands with the youthful
prince,’ Tiberius Claudius Nera—cohorti : ‘to the courtiers,’
about the prince.

17. Ut tu . . .feremus: the poet bids the muse to remind his
friend Celsus, that their future intimacy will depend upon him-
self: if in his high station he does not forget his old friend, nei-
ther will that friend forget him: ‘as thou bearest thy high for-
tune, Celsus, so will we conduct ourselves towards thee.'

EPISTLE IX.

This is a letter of introduction and commendation to Tiberius
Claudius Nero in behalf of Septimius, the poet’s particular friend.
The great delicacy necessary on such an occasion is manifestly
felt by Horace, who pleads the importunity of his friend, as an
excuse for what he does, with modesty and seeming reluctance.

1. Septimius . . . facias.- ‘ O Claudius, Septimius alone, forsooth,
knows how high I stand in your esteem.’

6. Quid . . . ipso .- ‘he sees and understands how much influ-
ence I have with you much better than I (lo myselfi'

10. Sic ego . . . praemia .· ‘ so Ι, to avoid the appearance of a
greater crime (unwillingness to serve a friend), have taken upon
myself a little modest assurance.' Des-cendi expresses his unwill-
ingness, and that he did not at first intend to do it.

EPISTLE X.

There are few persons insensible to the pleasures of the coun-
try. In Horace the love of rural retirement became a kind of
passion 3 and the praises he bestows in this e pistle on a country life,
and on contentment with one’s lot, are pleasing and instructive.
