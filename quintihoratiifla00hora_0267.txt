ODE III.

Augustus had desired Horace to write two odes3 one upon the
Secular games3 and the other upon the conquests of Drusus and
Tiberius in Pannonia. The poet commences this ode with the
praises of Drusus, as it was his first campaign, and as he was more
beloved by Augustus than Tiberius. In the XIIIth ode of this
book he continues the subject principally in praise of Tiberius.

1. Qualem . . . Vindelici.- the order of construction is, Qualem
olim juventas et patrius vigor propulit nido, inscium laborum, alitem
ministrum fulminis, (cui Jupiter, rest: deoru-m, permisit regnum in
vagas aves, expertus eum fidelem in rapiendo Ganymede flavo,) ver-
nique venti, nimbis jam remotis, docuere paventem insolitos nisus,-
mox, Ssc. . . . talem Vindelici videre Drusum gerentem bella sub
Rhaetis Alpibus—stlitem .· ‘ the eagle.'—-Ministrum fulminis .· ‘the
thunder-bearer.'

6. Laborum . . . inscium ,- ‘unused to flying.’

14. Ab ubere jam lacte depulsum .· i. e. “ ab ubere matris, adeoque
jam lacte, quo adhuc nutritus fuerat, depulsum.'’

18. Quibus (sc. Vindelicis) . . . distuli: it is matter of doubt to
commentators how these four verses came here. All admit them
to be unworthy of the poet, and brought in without apparent rea-
son. Some suppose it may have been a common question, when
talking of the conquests of Drusus, from whence the Vindelici de·
rived the custom of arming themselves with axes, like the
Amazons. Others think they may have been written in ridicule of
some other poet, who had attempted to celebrate the same con-
quests, and used some such language.

24. Consiliis . . . revictce .- ‘ vanquished by the wisdom of this·
youthful prince.' '

28. In pueros . . . Nerones .· ‚Tiberius and Drusus were the sons
of Tiberius Nero by Livia. When Augustus married their mother,
Livia, he adopted Tiberius and Drusus 3 and brought them up with
the same tenderness and care that he would have done, had they
been his own children.

35. Utcunque . . . culpae .- ‘ whenever good precepts are wanting,
vices obscure the natural endowments.’

38. Metaurum flumen : HasdrUbal, the brother of Hannibal, was
sent from Carthage with a powerful reinforcement to meet Han-
nibal in Italy3 and had he succeeded, the fate of Rome would
have been settled. Claudius Nero, then encamped in sight of
Hannibal, secretly left his camp with a detachmentof soldiers‚ and
defeated and slew Hasdrubal at the river Metaurus. The Cartha-
ginians did not even know of the departure of Nero, till he caused
the head os Hasdrubal to be thrown into their camp. This dispel-
