wine ; and others, that it was to be cooled by immersing in cold
water the vessel containing it. x

ODE IX.

Horace, being requested by Maecenas to celebrate the victories
of Caesar in an epic poem, replies that he is unfit for so high and
responsible a work3 and that his lyre is adapted to light and spor-

dicere dulces cantus dominae Ia'cymniae, voluit me dicere oculossul-
gentes luciditm: ‘my muse would rather I should celebrate the
sweet voice of thy beloved Licymnia,’ διο. It is generally 'sup-
posed that Terentia. is meant by Licymnia, and that the ode was
written about the time that Maecenas married that lady3 the word
domina is osten used to signify one dearly beloved.

15. Mutuis amoribus .· ‘with mutual attachment!

19. Ludentem nitidis virginibus .· ⁴ when dancing with the chaste-
and beautiful virgins! It is evident from this, that Terentia was
not yet married, or she would not have been admitted among the
virgins, who celebrated the sacred rites of Diana.
