ODE IV.

In the first part of this ode the poet describes the joy and beau-
ty os returning spring. He proceeds to exhort his friend Sextius
bo seize the pleasures that offer themselves, and, according to the
philosophy of the EpicureanS, he reminds him of the shortness os
life, as a motive for enjoying present gratificationS.

5. Cytherea choros ducit V enus : this refers to the feasts of Ve-
nus, which were celebrated by young women with dances and
hymns in honor of the goddess. They began on the first of April,
‘by the light of the 1noon,' imminente lumi, and continued three
nights successively.

ll. Immolare .· so deeply were the ancient heathens impressed
with the idea of the goodness of some overruling power, manifest-
ed in the return of the seasonS, that they offered stated sacrifices
in gratitude for this proof of continued care.

18. Non regna . . . talis: ‘you will not choose a king of the ι

feast by a cast of the dice.’ This refers to the practice of choos·

son was styled ‘king,’ and was chosen by throwing the dice,
which had on their different sides ‚the figures of saturn, Jupiter,
Mars, Apollo, Venus, and Diana„ ’ He who first threw a Venus

presided.
ODE V.

Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa was a distinguished general, and so
much esteemed by Augustus, that he gave him his daughter J ulia
in marriage. Agrippa wished his achievements to be celebrated
by Horace, who, while he excuses himself from the more laborious
and responsible task of writing a formal poem, ingeniously pays
him the most flatten'ng compliment. He intimates that Agrippa’s
martial glory deserves the strains of a loftier genius than his own3
that his was the lyric muse, and fit only for light or trifling sub-
jocts3 but that Varius, gifted with the sublimest inspirations of the
ἐμω muse, would sing his praises in strains worthy of the subject.

Most commentatore have thought thi‘s ode merely an excuse Q
Horace for not doing that which he had no disposition to do. But
the fulness of the praises bestowed renders this conjecturev super-
fluous. It is probably only an instance, among many„ ofhis ansui-
ly performing what he pretends to decline doing
