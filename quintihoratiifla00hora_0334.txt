EPISTLE XV.

Antonius Musa, physician to Augustus, had recommended the
cold bath to Horace, who practised cold bathing in Clusium and
Gabii. But finding the winter too severe, he resolved to go to
horne warnier climate, and try sea-bathing. For this reason, he
writes to his friend Numenius Vala, who had been using the baths
at Velia and Salernum, to give him some account of the climate,
people, accommodationS, dcc, The beginning of this epistle is
very much transposed and confused. We must look as far as the
twenty-fourth verse before we can get the natural arrangement
of the thoughts. ’

1. Qaae sit hiems .· before taking in this, it seems necessary to

nos accredere tibi, quce sit hiems Veliae3 i. e. you must write to

, me, Vala, what kind of winter you have at Velia7 and what the

climate of Salernum3 what is the character of the inhabitants,

and how the roads are 3 for Antonius Musa assures me that the

waters of Baiae are useless to me.

b 3. Illis .· i. e. to the people at Baiae, for slighting their warm
aths.

5. Sane . . . gemit.- ‘indeed the village is vexed that their
myrtle groves and sulphur baths should be neglected, so long

521. Tractus uter . . . apros: i. e. utra regio, Veliaene αη Salerni?
‘which region· produces hares in greatest abundance, and which
wild boars.'

23. Pinguis . . . Phaeaxque.- ‘plump, and a real Phaeacian3'
i. e. similis Alcinoo luxurioso regi Phaeacum.

32. Timidis .- these are they who, fearing the slanderous dis-
position of Maenius, entertained him in hope of escaping his cal-
ummes.

35. Scilicet. . . Bestius .· ‘forsooth, like the reformet Bestius,
he would declare all the while that the bellies of gluttons ought
to be branded with a hot iron.'—-.N'epotum.· ‘of gluttons.' The
Greeks and Romans branded the belly of a gluttonous slave ; the
feet of a fugitive 3 the hands of a thies, and the tongue of a bab-
bler. Dacier.

39. Bona .· ‘their estates?

41. ,Nimirum . . . sum .- ‘in fact, Just such a one am I.'

We may suppose that Quinctius had rallied Horace on the
extent and magnificence of his country-seat, that had chin-ms suf-
ficient to detain him so long from Rome. The poet, aster giving
