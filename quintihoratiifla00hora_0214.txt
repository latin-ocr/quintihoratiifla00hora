12. Domus Albunea: resonantis : various have been the conjec-
tures as to the meaning of these words. There was at Tibur,
now Tivoli, a wood‚ and near it a small lake or fountain, each called ⁸
Albunea, from a Sibyl of that name, whose temple still remains al·
most entire on the rock which causes and overhangs the first and
principal falls of the Anio at Tivoli. Some commentators suppose
the poet speaks of the country-seat of Plancus near this spot, and
some that he refers to a deep cavern in the rock just below the
falls, into which the waters rush with a great noise3 while others
understand him to mean the temple of the Sibyl, who in her re-
sponses is represented as ree‘choing the roar of the waterfalls. This
temple is certainly a most interesting ruin, and it forms at the pres-
ent day one of the most strikingly picturesque objects in this scene
of unrivalled beauty.

21. Teucer . . ,sugeret : ‘when Teucer fied from his native Sa-
lamis and from his father? Telamon, king of Salamis, sent his
two SonS, Teucer and Ajax, to the Trojan war, under an in-
junction that neither should return without his brother. When
Teucer returned, after the death of Ajax, he was banished by his
father, and went to Cyprus, where he built another Salamis. The
poet here reminds Plancus, that Teucer did not allow himself to
be depressed, although banished from his home and country, and
that he, therefore, should call some of his friends about him, and
regain his elasticity of spirit.

25. Melior fortuna parente .· ‘fortune, more kind than my fa-
ther.'

29. Ambiguum .· 1. 6. 116 would build a new Salamis, which
should so rival the old, as to render it doubtful which os them was
spoken of when the name of Salamis should 116 used.

ODE VII.

In this ode, addressed to Lydia, a female of great beauty, but of
worthless character, Horace draws the picture of a youth who has
become the victim of a deep and destructive passion.

2. Sybarin . . . perdere : ‘ why are you hastening to destroy Sy-
baris by cherishing his guilty passion ?'

Sybaris, a youth of fortune and of ingenuous character, having
yielded to the allurements of sensuality, had abandoned his manly
exercises and his former companions, and was hastening to de·
struction by that fatal infatuation which has led more youths to
perdition than the whole catalogue of other vices.

6. Impatis: the Romans had a kind of curb <bits called sraeni
lupari, from their resemblance to the uneven teeth of a wolf, lu-
Pug. Olivum: the ancients anointed their bodies with 011 before
commencing their gymnastic exercises.

10. Lividae i. e. bruised by wearing heavy armor.
