affairs in the East, till he was ordered by Augustus into Armenia.
It was at this time that Horace wrote this epistle to Florus, de-
scribing the route of Tiberius through Thrace, and requesting to
be informed on various subjects of public and private nature.
He'also advises Florus to be on good terms with Munatius, be-
tween whom there had been some misunderstanding.

Roman knight of fortune, taste‚ and elegance. He espoused the
cause of liberty with Brutus, and had suffered in his estate in con-

an uage.
