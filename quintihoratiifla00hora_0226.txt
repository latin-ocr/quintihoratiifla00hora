greater than himself had submitted to the same necessity.

10. Panthoiden .· the son of Panthoiis was Euphorbus, who was
slain at the Trojan war by Menelaus. Pythagoras, to establish his
doctrine of the transmigration of souls, declared‚ among other
proofs, that he was himself at the Trojan war, centuries before, in
the person of this Euphorbus3 and says he recognised, in the tem-
ple of Juno, the shield which he wore when he was Euphorhus3
which being taken down, refixo, was found to have the marks which
he had described as on his shield.

shall free you from punishment?

account of a siokness which prevailed in the army.

Iccius, a man of retired and literary habits, voluntarily joined the
expedition. Horace, with a good deal of pleasantry, ridicules Ic-

in his first campaign, the Sabaean kingS, ‘ never yet vanquished !'
