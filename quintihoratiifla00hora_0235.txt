ODE IV.

This ode is an expression of friendship to seminam, a Roman
knight of high standing. He was a poet and a soldier. He had
been a school-fellow, a long-tried and intimate friend of Horace,
who here tells him, that, as they had passed the best of their days
together in toils and dangers, he now wishes to retire with him,
and to spond the evening of life in tranquillity, either at his own
seat at Tibur, or with Septimius at Tarentum.

1. Aditure: ‘ready to go with me (if necessary) to Cadiz‚’ the
farthest part of Spain, ‘ and against the Cantabrian, not ye't subdu-
ed,’ διο. Almost all commentators are agreed that this is the
sense 3 as we say, I am ready to go with you any where: and not
that the poet actually anticipated any expedition of the kind here
mentioned.

5. Tibur . . . colono .· ‘Tibur, founded by an Argive colonist?
TiburnuS‚ Catillus, and Cora, three brothers from Argos, settled a
colony there.

’7. Lasso .· sc. mihi.

10. Pellitis ovibus .· the sheep of Tarentum, near which the river
Galaesus flowed, had wool of so fine a quality, that they were cov-
ered with skins to preserve it from injury.

11. Laconi . . . Phalanto .· ‘by Lacedemonian Phalantus) Lm
co, or Lacon,· gen. Laconis, adj.

14. U bi non . . . Venafro .· ‘where the honey does not yield to
that of Hymettus‚ and the olives vie with those of verdant Vena-
frum! Hymettus is a mountain in Attica abounding in the finest
honey. Venafrum is a city in Campania famous for its oil.

18. Aulon . . . uvis : the construction is, et Aulon amicus finili
Baccho minimam invidet Falernis uvis .- Aulon is a hill near Ta-
rentum.

ODE V.

There has been some doubt who the Pompey here addressed
was; some suppose it to have been Pompeius Varus. But it is
pretty generally believed that the address is to Pompeius Grosphus,
He was an early friend and companion of our poet, and was with him
at the battle of Philippi. He also continued in opposition to Au-
gustus afterwards. But when the peace was concluded between
Sextus Pompey and the Triumvirate, a general amnesty was grant-
ed to all Pompey's party. Grosphus, taking advantage of this, re-
turned to his friend53 on which occasion Horace addressed this
ode to him, by way of congratulafion, which naturally turns on
their common dangers and sufferings in former days,
