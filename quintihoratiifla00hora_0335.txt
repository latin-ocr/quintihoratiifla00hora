a description of his residence, falls into some moral reflections
which may have a bearing· on the character of Quinctius, and be
an offset to what he had before written to Horace.

1. Ne perconteris . . . ulmo .· ⁶ that you may not have the trouble
of inquiring, most excellent Quinctius, whether my farm supplies
its owner with grain, or entiches him with olives, fruits, pastur-
age, or vines covering the elms)

4. Loquaciler: ‘at full length.⁹

14. Infit-mo . . . alvo .· ‘and excellent for disorders of the head
and the stomach.’ ’

17. Quod audis .· ⁶ what you have the reputation of being.’

19. Sed vereor . . . beatum .- ‘but I sear that you rely more on
the judgment of others about yourself, than you do on your own 3

41. Com-ulta patrum .· ‘the decrees of the senate! ‚

49. Renuit negat atque Sabellus .- ‘I object to and deny that?
Horace pleasantly styles himself Sabellus .- inasmuch as country
people allow their slaves to take greater liberty than they have
in the city. The situation of atque after negat is unusual and
forced 3 and it has given occasion to various conjectures

60. Labra-movet.- i. e. after addressing Janus or Apollo, with

one else will hear him. Laverna was the “protectress of thieves
and impostors.

EPISTLE XVII.

Horace gives his young friend Scaeva some instructions re-
specting his conduct at court; that he may preserve his integ-
