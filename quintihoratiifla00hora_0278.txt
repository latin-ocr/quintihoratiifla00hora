Horace here describes the diabolical rites and ceremonies of an
’ assemblage of sorceresseS‚ of which Canidia is the principal char-
aeter. They have taken a boy of noble birth, whom they are
about to put to death by torture, in order to prepare from his mar-
row and dried liver a philtre, or love potion, capable of recalling
Varus, an inconstant lover of Canidia.
