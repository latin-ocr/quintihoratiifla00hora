292 NOTES.

9. Postquam . . ‚sorte-3, sse. .· ⁶ aster all attempts to make up the
breach had failed, (for all, between whom there happens a quar-
rel, are obstinate in their hostility in the same degree that'they
are brave,' &c

19. Rupili . ) . pugnat.- ‘the pair Rupilius and Persius enter
the lists! The idiom of our language does not admit of a literal
translation of these genitives in their present use.

20. Bacchius .- he says the gladiatore ‘Bacchius and Bithus were
not more equally matched.’ They always put to death whoever
fought with them. They afterwards engaged each other, and both
expired on the stage. '

25. Canem: ‘the dog-star!

27. Fertur qut) rara securis .· ‘ where the axe is seldom carried ς’
i. e. where the wood is very thick, inasmuch as it has seldom, if
ever, been cut. Persius, choked with rage, is compared to a win-
ter torrent impeded by the brush and trees in its course.

28. Tum . . . cuculum: ‘then Rupilius of Praeneste directs
against his cutting and very fiuent adversary invectives drawn
from the low raillery of the vineyard, like a coarse and invincible
vintager‚ to whom the passenger‚ when calling him cuclcoo with all
his strength, has often been obliged to yield.' ·

29. Expressa arbusto .· i. e. drawn from the coarse raillery of
the vineyard. The vines grew upon trees beside the road3 and
those who went up to gather the grapes were exposed to the jibes
of travellers‚ which were commonly retorted upon them. This
custom of training vines upon trees still prevails in most parts
of modern Italy. The vines hang in graceful festoons from tree
to tree at some rods distance from each other, and are often made
to assume fanciful forms of much variety and beauty.

31. C'uculum: the lazy and thievish habits of the cuckoo
have rendered the name of this bird a term of reproach in most
languages. The European cuckoo builds for itself no nest, but
drops its eggs into the nests of other birds, and leaves them and
the care of its young to chance. But this is not true of the Ameri-
can cuckoo‚ which builds its own nest and supports its young like
other birds.†—Wilson’s Ornithology.

34. Reges . . . tollere .· Brutus had only shared in killing Caesar,
but his ancestor, Lucius J unius Brutus, had expelled the Tarquins.

SATIRE VIII.

The poet introduces Priapus, overseer of gmdens, complaining
against the sorceresses Canidia and Sagana, and describing their ,
secret enchantments and their diabolical practices. His object is
to ridicule the superstitions of the times.

3. Maluit esse deum .· ‘ concluded to make a god of me.’ When
the artificer found the inutile lignum unfit even for a stool to sit
upon, he made a god of it. This is satire indeed upon the my-
thology of his country.
