288 NOTES.

62. Campanum in morbum.- ‘the Campanian disease,’ here al-
luded to, caused protuberances like warts to grow out and dis-
figure the face.

63. Pastorem . . . Cyclopa.- ‘that he would personate the Cy-
clops in a dance.’ Messius seemed well calculated for this char-
acter, as a deep sear in the forehead gave him the look of Poly·

,phemus3 and he could represent him without mask or buskins.

65. Catenam: slaves of the meanest class were chained3 and
when freed, they consecrated their chains to Saturn. But Sarmen-
tus, who had run away, is supposed to have consecrated his chains
to the Lares, who were invoked by travellers.

67. Dominae .- the right of his former mistress was no less per-
fectbover him, although he had got clear of her, and was now a
scr1 e.

69. Libra.- a pound of bread a day was the lawful allowance
for a slave 3 and he intimates that one so lank and meagre should
have been contented with it.

78. Atabulus: a destructive wind called Sirocco. Doer.

79. Erepscmus .· by Syncope for erepsissemu-s.

83. Quod . . . ‘non est .· ‘ which cannot be named in verse ς’ al-

the selling of water, and the excellence of its bread. This town
is supposed to be Eqvuotaticum, which name he could not use in
hexameter verse.

84. Venit.- ‘is sold.’

85. Ιέῖίνὰ .- i. e. the traveller carried this bread along with him,
‘be on .’

9353. Lymphis iratis exstructa .· there are two meanings to this
expression3 one that the town was built in despite of the enraged
waters; and the other, that its inhabitants were lunatics and vis-
ionaries. Francis has expressed it thus:

‘⁶ Then water-curs’d Egnatia gave us joke,

And laughter great, to hear the moon-struck folk
Assert‚ if incense on their altars lay,

Without the help of fire it melts away.’'

96. deaeus Apella: ‘the J ew Apella)

97. Deos .· the Epicureans believed that the gods did not con·
cern themselves about the affairs of this world.

SATIRE VI.

In this satire Horace attempts to show that real greatness is
quite independent of externa] circumstances; and that true no-
bility consists in persona] worth, and not in the distinctions of
birth and family. He mentions his own case as a proof that
Maecenas selected his friends for their personal qualides, since ’
he had no advantages of family to recommend him. And he pays
a grateful tribute to the memory of his father, for having trained
