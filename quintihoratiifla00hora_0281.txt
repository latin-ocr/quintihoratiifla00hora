EPODE IX.

This epode seems to be an ebullition of ill nature and of impre-
cations against Mae-vius, quite unworthy of our poet. This Maevi-
us was detested by both Virgil and Horace, as a vile and despica-
ble poetaster. He was about to sail for Greece3 and as Horace
had wished virgil a prosperous voyage to Greece in Book I. Ode
ΠΙ. ; so he now prays for disasters upon his enemy Maevius.
