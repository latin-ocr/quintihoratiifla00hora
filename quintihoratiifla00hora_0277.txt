EPODE IV.

In this epode the poet inveighs vehemently against some ger-
son, who, from the condition of a slave, had become a mi ary
tribune, and was making an offensive display of his wealth and
dignity, to the annoyance of the more reputable part of the com-
munity. It is commonly supposed to be addressed to Menas, a
freedman of Cneus Pompey, and in most manuscripts it is inscrib-
ed to him.

1. Lupis . . . compede .· the construction is, Quanta discordia
sortito obtigit lupis et agnis, tanta est mihi tecum, O Mena, peruste
quod ad latus fiinibus Ibericis, et quod ad crura durd compede.—
Sortito .- ‘ naturally)

3. Per-uste.- ‘marred or hardened.' Menas had been a pirate
before he served Pompey, and had been scourged, and in chains.

7. Metiente te .· ‘ as you proudly strut along)

seats in the theatre to the equestrian order separate from the
people 3 and also made a distinction between those who were
knights by birth, and those who were promoted to that rank. This
fellovv, who had been a slave, takes his place in the first seatS, which
were appropriated exclusively to those born knights.

17. Quid attinet . . . pondere .· i. e. to what purpose is it that so
many brazen·beaked ships were sent?

20. Hoc . . . militum.- ‘if such a wretch be made military tri-
bunc!
