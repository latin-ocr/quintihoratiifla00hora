ODE V.

This ode seems to have been written in honor of Augustus. 1t
sets forth his achievementS, and represents him as the guardian
god of the Roman people.

1. Coelo . . . regnare.- ‘we have been accustomed to believe
that Jove reigns in heaven from hearing him thunder there.’

2. Praesens clivus : ⁶ a god upon earth ε’ i. e. so Augustus, by his
conquests and his services to his country, shall be hailed as a visi-
ble divinity. Presens has this signification, and not propitius, sa-
vens, as some have supposed.

4. Persis .· it is said that Phraates, king of the Parthians, aster
being restored to his throne, was so alarmed merely at the report
that Augustus was about to make war upon him, that he volunta-
rily sent an embassy to him, and offered to restore the military
standards that had been lost several years before at the defeat of
Crassus. The Parthians are here meant by Persis. Augustus
did not in reality subdue either the Britons or Parthians, but the
people submitted to the authority of his name. See Book I. Ode
