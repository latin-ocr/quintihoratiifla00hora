SATIRE IX.

The class of impertinent obtruders described, and most happily
hit off, in this satire, is too numerous to be unknown to any, and
too great a nuisance not to be detested by all. The poet gives
a humorous account of a fellow who accidentally met him in his
walk, and whom he found it impossible to shake off.

1. Via Sacrd: this was the street through which triumpha]
processions passed to the Capitol.

2. Totus in illis : 4 wholly absorbed in them?

5. Suaviter . . . est .· ‘pretty well, at present)

6. Quum . . . occupo .- ⁶ when he would follow, 44 Is there any-
thing you wish of me ?” I ask.' Num quid vis 52 this was a form
of taking leave, when one did not wish to appear too abrupt in
quitting another.-—Occupo‚ for proeoccupo, i. e. I ask before he
can begin a set speech at me.

7. Νόήε . . . sumus.- sc. velim ut ,· ‘but he replies, 44Ι wish
you to be acquainted with me ς Ι am a man of letterS.” '

10. Puero .· 4 10 my servant boy.’

11. 'cerebri felicem .· ‘happy of temperament) He congratulates
Bolanus, who was of a quick and irritable temper, on his faculty
of getting rid of such fellows at once.

15. Sed nil agis .· ‘ but you will not succeed.’

18. Cubat is .· 4116 lies sick,’ or ‘ he is confined to his bed.’

20. Iniquae mentis .· 4 dicontented.'

24. Quis . . . canto .- 4 who can dance more gracefully? and
Hermogenes himself would envy my singing.’

28. Omnes composui: ‘ I have buried them all.'

29. Sabella . . . urmi: ‘which a Sabine fortune-teller predicted
to me when a boy, the old woman having shaken her magic urn.’
Letters and words were put into an urn, which was then well
shaken3 and the fortune was inferred from the arrangement these
assumed on being thrown out.

33. Quandocunque .· separated by tmesis; ‘one day?

35. Ad Vestoe .- sc, templum.

36. Respondet-e vadato .· ‘to answer to his hail? If he failed,
he forfeited the penalty of his recog-nizance.

38. Inter-eam . . . jura .- ‘mayI die, if I am able to stand advo-
cate, or have any knowledge of the laws of the state.' This seems
to be the meaning of stare ; though several commentatore consider
it used in its literal sense, and understand the poet to say that he
is unable to stand through a trial in a court of justice.

41.‘ Me, sodes .· ‘me‚ Ι pray,' Horace replies, wishing to shake
him off. Sedes is a conti-action for si audes.

43. Maecenas quomodo tecum: 4011 what footing are you with
