Marsyas in the forum, near the Rostra, where the judges, lawyers,

humorously represents the statue as frowning with indignation
at the sight of the younger of the N ovii, who, from a slave, was
become an officious and bustling magistrate. Some suppose the

SATIRE VII.

While Horace was military tribune in the army of Brutus,
there was in the same camp one Rupilius Rex, who, J'ealous of
his advanccinent, osten reproached him with his low birth. Our
poet,vby way of retaliation for this insolence, takes occasion to
describe to Brutus a contest that happened one day between Rex
and one Persius, a merchant, who was there for the purpose of
trade. He gives the whole an air of solemnity which heightens
the burlesque. Ἰ
