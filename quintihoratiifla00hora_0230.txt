ODE XXX.

Plotius Numida had been three years with Augustus, engaged
in a war in Spain. On his return, he was received with demon-
strations of joy and thanksgiving by his friend Horace3 who, on
this happy occasion, assembled the friends of Plotius, and among
them AElius Lamia, a school-fellow of Plotius, and dearly beloved
gy him. This celebration was attended with sacrifices, songs, and

anceS. ·

2. Placare .· ‘to propitiate.' This word may with propriety be
used, although Plotius had returned in safety3 since his friends
were still bound to the performance of their vows 3 and would have

ἷθᾶῗοὲι to sear the resentment of the gods if this should be neg-
ec e .

5. Multa .· sc. dividit oscula.

8. Νοη alio rege .· it was customary among the Romans to call
the tutor or governor of a nobleman’s children rex, or king. Plotius
and Lamia had not only passed their boyhood together under the
same tutor, but had assumed the manly gown, toga virilis, at the
same time.

9. .Mutatae.· i. e. the toga proetexta, which was bordered with
purple, was laid aside for the toga virilis, which was of pure white,
and assumed at the age of seventeen yearS. This change of the
toga was attended with some solemnity, and usually before the
images of the Lares,

10. Cras-sci .· fortunate and happy days were marked with chalk,
or a white stone3 and unlucky days with a black mark, or a black
stone. These were added up at the end of the year.

12. Morem in Salium.- for Saliorum ‚· ‘aster the manner of the
Salii) These were the twelve priests of Mars. See Lempriere.

13. Damalis .· this was a woman of light character, notorious for
her love oswine.

114. Bassum.- Bassus was a companion of Plotius, and a hard

dnnker.
ODE XXXI.

The death of Cleopatra put an end to the war between Augus
tus and Antony. This is one of several odes which Horace wrote ι
on that occasion. The character and tragica] end of Cleopatra
are strikingly represented. Her passions are in violent motion3
her ambition is intoxication3 her love is madness; and her cour·

age is despair. The soul of the poet seems kindled with unusual

fite.

2. Saliaribus . . . dapibus .· The feasts of the Salii were of the
most splendid and costly kind. The poet here probably means to
say that it is proper to prepare a lectisternium ,- which was a feast
at which the gods were invited to attend. and for whom couches
