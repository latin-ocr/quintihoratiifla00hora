worthless characters as get their living by imposing upon people.
-Balatrones.· ‘buffoons, rope-dancerS,' or any worthless para-

SATIRE ΙΙΙ.

The poet would show, in this satire, that the faults of friends
must not be too severely censured. He also ridicules the dog-
mas of the Stoics, who allowed no distinction between crimes, but
maintained that all should be punished with equal severity.

3. Sardus: ‘of Sardinia?

6. Ab ovo . . . mala .· i. e. from beginning to end. Eggs were
served first, and fruit last, at dinner.

7. Ιο Bacche .· this was the beginning or the chorus of a song,
repeated by Tigellius, probably of his own composition—Summo
voce . . . ima .· ‘sometimes on the highest key, and sometimes on
the lowest3 i. e. hac voce, quae resonat ima quattuor chordis. Some
commentators make summa and ima to agree with chorda, and to
refer to the situation of the strings in the instrument called the
tetrachord. According to this interpretation3 summa and ima,
referring to their position, would express ‘the base and treble.’
