BOOK II.

EPISTLE Ι.

AUGUSTUS had complained that Horace had not addressed any

’ of his satires or epistles to him. In this beautiful and finished

epistle the poet makes ample amends for his former remissness.
In the first part of it he examines the comparison between the ·
ancients and the moderns, which has been matter of dispute in
all ages. He next shows the folly of that excessive love of an-
tiqusty, which regarded the time of any performance rather than

its merits. In the third place he treats of the theatre‚ and of the ’

difficulty of succeeding there. And finally he would remind
princes how important it is for them to encourage a spirit of emu-
lation for epic poetry, by which their own achievements may be
celebrated. ’

10. Qui .· Hercules slew the hydra of Lerna.

13. Artes .· for artifices : one eminent in any department de-
presses, by his fame, those who are inferior to him.

23. Sic fautor veterum.- the idea is, So “extravagantly do the
people admire the works of antiquity, that they would say, the
Muses themselves uttered, on Mount Alba, the laws of the
Twelve Tables, the treaty with the Gabii, διο. These were
among the first productione of the Romans, and certainly not to
be considered as models in composition.

28. Si, quia . . . loquamur: ‘if, because the most ancient
works of the Greeks are the best, we are to weigh Roman
fflrs’in the. same balance, it is in vain bo say any thing

er.
