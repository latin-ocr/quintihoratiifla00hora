ODE XXII.

Μικ- Sanadon says, that Horace was at an entertainment where
a dispute began to inflaine some of the company already heated
with wine. Instead of attempting to restore peace by grave ad-
vice and sober reasoning, he gayly proposed to drown all disputes
in a bumper3 which having succeeded, he wrote a few lines on
the occasion.

5. Vino et lucernis . . . discrepat.- ‘how strangely abhorrent is
the Persian sword from wine and candles :’ i. e. the festive board3
for the Romans usually had their entertainments by candle-light.

8. Cubita . . . presso .· this alludes to the custom of reclining at
table with the left elbow resting on a couch.

ODE XXIII.

The occasion of this ode is not known3 although it has been the
subject of various conjectures. It is a dialogue, represented as
having taken place between a mariner and the shade of Archytas,
a celebrated mathematician and philosopher of Tarentum.

Archytas had been shipwrecked on the coast of Apulia3 and
the poet represents a mariner, who had accidentally found his
body driven ashore by the waves, as thus exclaiming: ‘ And could
not you escape death, Archytas! How small a space you cover,
who could measure the heavens, the earth, and the seal' . The ad-
dress of the mariner occupies the first six verses, and the reply
continues through the ode.

1. Te maris . . . munera: the construction is, Archyta, parva
munera exigui pulveris cohibent te, mensorem maris et terrae arence-
que carentis numero, prope Matinum littus.

2. cohibent .- ‘receive, confine.’ Commentators differ as to the
meaning of this word. Bentley and Doering consider it as here
given3 viz. ‘a small quantity of earth is sufficient for you now,
who lately stretched your mind over the vast expanse of heaven,
the wide extended ocean, and the land. But Dacier‚ Gesner, and
others think the meaning to be this: ‘the trifling favor of a little
dust to cover your body detains you from the Elysian fields 3⁷ allu
ding to the prevailing belief that the soul could not pass the Styx
under a hundred years, if the body were not buried. To this, ref-
erence is made at the conclusion of the ode, where the mariner is
entreated to render this little service, of throwing earth upon the
body, which was of so much consequence to the soul.

7. Occidit: The shade of Archytas here replies to this effect:
‘ Do not be surprised, manner, that I have shared the common lot
of humanity3 for Tantalus died, though he was admitted to the
society of the 2*ng and TithonuS, Pythagoras,’ διο. Archytas
