EPODES. 257

EPODE I.

This epode was written on the eve of the great engagement be-
tween Augustus on one side, and Antony with Cleopatra's forces
and ficet on the other. Maecenas had refused to have Horace ac-
company him on this expedition, as he had been accustomed to do
on similar occasions. The poet feels evidently hurt by the refu-
sal. He expresses his anxiety and deep concern.

1. Ibis . . . propugnacula : ‘ you will then venture, O my friend
Maecenas, with light Liburnian galleyS, amidst the losty bulwarks
of Antony⁷s ships? The fleot of Augustus was composed‚ in a
great measure, of these light galleyS. See Book I. Ode XXXI.

5. Quid 7105· . . . gravis .· ‘and what shall I do, to whom life is
delightful, while you survive, but to whom it would be a burden,
were you taken away.’

7. Jussi : sc. ate.

9. Hunc laborem : i. e. the danger of this campaign.

21. Ut adsit .- ⁶ although she were with them) We find ut
used in this way for licet by other writers also.

25. Ut juvencis. . . meis: by hypallage, for ut plures juvenca
illigati meis aratris nitantur.

27. Calabris . . . Lucana mutet.- by hypallage, for Calabra

mer pasturage.

29. N'ec ut . . . mnia .· i. e. nor that my Sabine villa, built of
white marble, may extend to the walls of Tusculum, far above it.
Tusculum was built by Telegonus, the son of Circe3 hence Cir-
caea moenia. It was more than twenty miles from Horace's coun-
tr seat.

y33. Avarus . . . premam .- ‘ I may bury in the earth, like avari-
cious old Chremes.' This is a character in a play of Terence.

34. Discinctu.s . . . nepos .· ‘or prodigal may squander away like
a spendthrift? The Romans tied up their gowns with a girdle
when they were at work, and wished to be free from incumbrance ;
hence the phrase accingere ad opus. But when unemployed they
suffered them to flovv loosely; hence discinctus and dissolutus sig-
nify an effeminate and negligent person.-2-Nepos .- this word,
which originally signified a grandson, from the too great indulgence
generally shown by grandfathers, and the ruin that ensued, became
the common term for ‘ spendthrist.'

renouncing his mode of life, and who had resolved on retiring from
