ODE XIII.

The Romans believed that many of their gods passed their sum-
mers in one country, and their winters in another. Faunus was
of this number. He was supposed to come into Italy on the 13th
of February, and to return to Arcadia on the 5th of December.
Both these days were observed by sacrifices and festivity in¹ hon-
or of Faunus, who was supposed to preside over their flocks and
fields. This ode was probably written for one of his festivals.
In the first part, the poet entreats Faunus, if he pays him due hon-
orS, to smile upon his fields, and preserve the tender offspring of
his fiocks 3 and in the second, he sets forth the joy of the village
on the return of his autumna] feast, when man and beast will re-
lax from their toil, and rejoice in the bounty of their benefactor.

3. Abeasque . . . alumnis: ‘and may you depart propitious to
the young of my fiocks.’

6. Veneris sodali .- he calls the cratera the companion of Venus,

son of the autumna] feast to FaunuS.

16. Ter pede terram .· a part of the festivities on this occasion
consisted in dancing.

ODE XIV.

It seems that Murena had been chosen augur, and that several
of his friends had met together in honor of the occasion 3 and that
among them were Horace, and another poet named Telephus, who
was a great scholar, and who undertook to entertain the company
with some grave discussion on ancient history. Horace interrupte
him by intimating that it were better to inquire where the best
wine was to be had, with the requisites for an entertainment, that
they might drink their friend's health in honor of his new appoint-
ment. The hint succeeded, and we are to imagine our poet in
the midst of the entertainment, giving orders for the manner of
drinking, as though he were king of the feast.

1. Quantum: i. e. O Telephus, you relate how many ages pass-
ed between Inachus and Codrus, who devoted himself to death for
his countr . ,

6. Qnisy. . . ‘ignibus .· ‘ who will get the baths ready.’ The Ro-
mans always bathed before they sat down to their entertainmentS.
