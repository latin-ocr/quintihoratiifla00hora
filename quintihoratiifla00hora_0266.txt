ODE II.

Horace addresses this ode to the Muse Melpomene, as the pa-
troness of lyric poetry. He thanks the Muses for their favors to
him even from the hour of his birth; and seems to imply that he
received in the first moments of life whatever distinguished him
afterwards. The ode is written with so much beauty and feeling,
that Scaliger says he would rather be the author of it, than be the
king of Arragon.
