ODE II.

In as much as the Romans had relaxed the strictness of their
discipline, and fallen into luxury and vice, the poet exhorts them to
commence a reform by educating their children differently. He
intimates that they should early be inured to labor and privation,
that, by enduring the hardships of warfare, they may prize the bless-

25. Est et . . . merces .· This seems to be another topic, relating
