ODE Xl.

This ode is written in a playful, familiar manner, to invite Vir·

poet, though some have imagined it to be another person.

ODE XII.

Horace in his youth had been much in love with Lyce, a beau·
tiful‚ but proud girl, who did not reciprocate his passion. He now
takes occasion to insult her by triumphing over her faded charms,
and exulting at the ravages which time has made upon her beau-
ty. It would have been well for the reputation of the poet, isthic
ode had not been written.

9. Nec Cooe . . .purpurae .· ‘neither the purple from Cos? This was
an island in the AEgean sea, from which choice silim were brought.
