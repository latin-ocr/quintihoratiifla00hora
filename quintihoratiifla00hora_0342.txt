EPISTLE II.

Julius Florus, to whom this epistle is addressed‚ was, at the
time it was written, absent with Tiberius Nero. Horace gives
his reasons for not having complied with the request of Florus
that he would send him some lyric poemS. He tells him that he
wished to devote himself to the study of philosophy. And
throughout the epistle he intersperses many excellent precepts
for the regulation of the conduct, and for seem-ing a good and

⁷ happy life. He commences with alively and amusing account

of a slave-dealer, as an example of the verbosity and knavery of
that class of men.

12. Meo . . . oere .· ‘ I am short for money, but owe nobody.’

14. Semel hic cessavit .· ‘he was once in fault3 and hid himself
behind the stairs for fear of the whip, as was natural enough.'
Doe'ring prefers this construction to pendentis in scalis, the usual
one. The seller uses the word cessavit for azgs'ugim to sosten
the crime of running away, which was considered so important
a defect in the character of a slave, that the sale was made void
by laW‚ if this was not mentioned to the purchaser.

17. Ille .· i. e. the slave-dealer who sells the slave.-Poenae se-
curus .· ‘fearless of any punishmentss for the fraud hecommitted3
as the law could not reach him, after he had mentioned the fact
that the slave had run away.

23. Quid . . . attentas : ·‘ what then have I gained by my conces-
sion, if, nevertheless‚ you impeach the laws protecting me ?’—Me-
cum facientia: i. e. me adjuvantia. J aeck.

28. Vehemens lupus .· sc. ut .· ‘like a raging wolf.’

43. Bonce Athenae: ‘kind Athens!

48. Νοη responsura lacertis : ‘ unable to cope with the arms,’
or forces of Augustus Caesar.

52. Sed quod . . . vers-us .· i. e. but now possessing every thing
that I wish, what doses of hellebore could cure my madness if Ι
did not think it better to sleep quietly than to attempt writing

oetry again?
p 60. Bioneis sermonibus .- i. e. with such keen satire as Bion of
Borysthenes is said to have written.
65. Praeter coetera .· ‘ above all?
