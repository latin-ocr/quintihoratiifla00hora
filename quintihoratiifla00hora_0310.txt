SATIRE III.

This satire, written by way of dialogue, is intended to show that
all mankind are either madmen or fools. Horace had retired in-
to the country during the Saturnalia. Damasippus, a stoic phi-
losopher, pays him a visit, and in conversation blames h1m for not
writing and publishing something neW, instead of remaining idle,
or retouching his former works. The discourse, by an easy tran-
sition, turns upon Damasippus and his mode of life. This leads
to an explanation of the doctrines of the stoics, and a justification
of their dogmas. The various passions, which tyrannize over the
human heart, are portrayed with inimitable skill. The whole
conversation is interspersed with moral reflections and useful
instruction.
