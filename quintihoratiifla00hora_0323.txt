30. Ingustata: ⁶ such as had never been tasted.’

32. Ab ipso . . . melius .· ‘you will learn best from him?

34. Βαφηηοεὲ .· i. e. unless we drink this eternal talker dumb.

39. Invertunt . . . tota: ‘empty whole jars of wine into Alli-
phanian cupS.’——Alliphanis .· sc. poculis .- made at Alliphae.

40. Imi: the host and his two parasites were on the lowest
couch. They spared the bottles on their side.

46. Garo . . . coquitur: ‘ with the pickle of Spanish mackerel,
and with wine of this country, five years old, poured in when the
sauce was boiling.’

48. Cocio .· ⁴ when boiledff—Chium vinum sic convenit illi cocto,
ut non ullum aliud magis Ῑιος.

67. Tene.- sc. num (equum est? addressed to Nasidienus3 ‘is
it right for yon, racked with solicitude, to be tortured with every
species of anxiety, that I may be splendidly entertained, &c.’?

72. Agaso: ‘a groorn,’ implying that Nasidienus had taken
his grooms from the stable to attend at dinner. His speech is a

takes all in earnest, and breaks forth in grateful expressions
to Balatro.

quite another countenance.’

91. Sine clune .· these ringdoves were probably bought cheap3
since the rumpS, the most delicate part, were so tainted as to be
unfit for the table.

praising and descanting on everything, that they were glad to
escape both from him and his entertainment.
