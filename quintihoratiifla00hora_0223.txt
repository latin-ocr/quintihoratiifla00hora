omas. Boon 1. 215

5. Laetam .· sc. Dianam5 ‘delighting in.’

9. Tempe .· to this delightful vale Apollo retired aster lle slew
the serpent Python.

11. Insignemque . . . lyr-(i.- ‘and the shoulder of Apollo graced
with his quiver and the lyre received from his brother.' Mercury,
the inventor of the lyre, presented it to Apollo.

ODE XIX.

In this elegant and beautiful ode, Horace describes to his friend ·
Fuscus, the rhetorician, the advantages of uprightness of character
and purity of life. These are the best defence, and afford the
greatest security, a man can have.

1. Integer . . . purus: ‘a man of upright life, and free from

uilt.'

g 5. Syrtes . . . aestuosus: the poet does not here speak of the rna-
rine Syrtes, but the sandy deserts of Africa, where the scorching
heat of the sun renders the region at times impassable. AEstuosas
may refer to the heat of the sandS, from cestus,- or to the fiuctua-
ting nature of the quicksands, which arc driven about by the wind
in billows like water. The word Syrtes comes from m‘st, ‘to
drag, or sweep along.’

7. Fabalosus .· the river Hydaspes is so called from the fabulous
reports of its washing gold and gems along with its water.

8. Lambit: for alluit. .

15. Jubae tellus .· Mauritania, which was subject to J uba.

17. Pigra?- . . . canqris .· he first speaks of the frigid zone, then
of the torri .

22. Τεννά domibus neg-atti : the ancients entertained the opinion,
that the torrid zone was uninhabitable‚ on account of the heat,
which error modern experience has corrected.

ODE XX.

Quinctilius Varus, a distinguished poet of Cremona, was the
intimate and mutual friend of Horace and Virgil3 but perhaps en-
deared to no one more than to the latter. He died in the seven
hundred and twenty-ninth year of Rome. The death of Varus was
most dgeply felt by Virgil‚ to whom this ode 1s addressed by way
of con olence.

2. Praecipe . . . Melpomene .· ‘ O Melpomene, teachx me the
mournfu] sti-ains! Horace, with much propriety, invokes the Muse
of Tragedy to aid him in the tribute he is about to pay to the worth
gf their lamented friend3 for whom no measure of grief seemed 'to

e excesswe.
