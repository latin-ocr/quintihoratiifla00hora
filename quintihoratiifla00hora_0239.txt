ODE X.

Horace, having narrowly escaped with his life from the fall of
a tree whilst he was walking on his farm, breaks out with dread‘
ful imprecations upon the tree and the person who planted it.

He is naturally led to reflect on the dangers to which we are
at all times exposed, and against which it is impossible to be suf-
ficiently guarded. His thoughts are turned to the world of spirits,
to which he came so near being sent unawares. And by way of
compliment to lyric poetry, he represents the shades, and even
Cerberus and the Furios, as overpowered by the music of Sappho
and Alcaeus.

cost commentators much trouble. They are generally of opinion.
that there is something wrong or imperfect in the construction os
it. But it may be construed as above without much violence or
mconsistency.
