ODE XVII.

It seems that Maecenas had intimated to Horace his intention os
making him a visit at his country-seat at Tibur, in the Sabine ter-
ritory, about twenty or twenty-five miles from Rome.

The poet intends to give his illustrious friend a welcome to his
house, but, to prevent any disappointment in one accustomed to the
choice wines and other luxuries of the court at Rome, he tells him
ne will find but plain fare.

l. Vile . . . Sabinum .· ‘ cheap Sabine wine)

2. Graecd . . ,plau-sus: ‘which I sealed in a Grecian jar the
very day on which you received such applause in the theatre.’
—Testd .· the Romans, when most careful to preserve their wine,
and to correct its crudity, put it into earthen jars, which were at
first imported from Greece.-—Levi : from lino ,- when the jars were
filled, they were sealed or closed up with pitch or wax. Although
the Sabine wine was by no means worthy of so much care and ex-
pense, yet, as on, the occasion referred to, Maecenas, on making
his appearance at 1110 11100110 for the first time after a severe ill-
neSS, had been received with acclamations and shouts of joy, Ho-
race had preserved the date in this way3 and now pays a very
delicate compliment to his patron by alluding to that circum-
stance.⁴

5. Paterni fluminis .- the Tiber flows from Etruria, where the
ancestors of Maecenas dwelt.

8. Imago: ‘the echo.' ·

9'. Praelo . . . Caleno: ‘by a Calenian wine-mess! The best
presses were made at Cales. The sense seems to be this3 ‘You
wil] drink the choice Caecubian wine, at home if you please, or
where 11 15 10 110 had3 but I have neither Falernian nor Formian
wine! Some suppose this to be a hint for Maecenas to bring some
wine with him, better than was to be found at Tibur.

ODE XVIII.

This is a hymn of praise and thanksgiving to Apollo and Diana,
to be sung by a 011011 of twenty-seven young men, and another
choir os the same number of young virgins, on a day consecrated ’
to the worship of these tutelary djvinities. The poet seems 10
take the part of a priest of Apollo, and 10 dictate 10 each choir
what 10 5111σ.

. 1. Tener} . . . virgines .· the choir of virgins 15 first exhorted to
ΜΞ Ῥηῗοξὶςῗῑτῗε Of &abiglam .· 111011 1110 choir of young men is ex-
hortcd to sing the praises of Apollo.

3. Latonamque . . . Jovi .· ‘ Sing too Latona, the mother of both,
supremely loved by almighty J ove.’
