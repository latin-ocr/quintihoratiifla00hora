THE LIFE OF HORACE.

———

QUINTUS HonA'rms FLACCUS was born at Venusium in Apulia,
sixty-four years before Christ. His father was a freedman, and
collector of the revenue 3 and gave his son a liberal education at
Rome and Athens. After enjoying the best means of in-
struction that Rome afforded, at the age of about twenty-one, Hor-
ace was sent to Athens to complete his education. Whilst Horace
was at AthenS, Caesar was assassinated3 and Brutus and Cassius
repaired to that city, in order to enlist in the cause of freedom the
young Romans who were pursuing their studies there. Horace
attached himself to Brutus, under whom he served nearly two

which, not to quarrel with its brevity, I take in good part. But
you seem to me fearful, lest your works should be bigger than
yourself. However, what you want in height, is made up to you
by that little round body of yourS. You should, therefore, write
such a roll, as may go, not round a stick, but a quart measure,
and then the circumference of your volume may be squab and
swollen, like the rotundity of your little belly.’' “ This is apleasing
persona] trait. Horace has, himself, given us some interesting
hints of his person and manners. He was gray before his time3
fond of basking in the sun3 and of taking a siesta on the bank of
a river. He speaks of breaking stones and turning up the ground,
when in the country, and when in town, of sauntering in the mar-
ket, or riding out on a dock-tailed mule, which he sat awkwardly.
He dined on a pancake and vegetables 3 and divided the rest of
