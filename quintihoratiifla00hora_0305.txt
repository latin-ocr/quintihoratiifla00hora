SATIRES. ‘BOOK 1. 10. 297

which, there being three metres to each verse, the time was
marked by three stamps of the musician's foot, one after each
metre.— Forte . . . ducit .- ⁶ the spirited Varius conducts the manly
Epic in a style that none can equal.⁷

46. Hoc . . . minor: sc. genus scribendi: ‘this was the kind of.
writing which, aster it had been in vain attempted by Atacinian
Varro and certain others, I was able to follow with better success3
though inferior to the inventor?

48. Inventor-e minor .· Lucilio; Horace acknowledged Lu-
cilius to be the inventor of satire, and in that species of writing
his superior.

50. Heme : i. e. Lucilius.

54. N’on ridet . . . minores .· ‘ does he not laugh at the poetry of
Ennius, as wanting in dignity P‘

55. N'on zat . . . reprensis .· ‘not as superior to those censured.’

57. Quaerere . . . comanis .· 6to examine whether his own ge-
nius, or the difficult nature of the subjects he writes upon, has de·—
nied him more finished and more smoothly-flowing verses3 as if
any one, satisfied with this simply, the putting of anything into
hexameterS, should pride himself on having written two hundred
verses before supper, and as many aster it?

63. Capsis . . . propriis .- ‘whom report makes to have been
burnt with his own books and book-cases) See Class. Dict.

66. Quam . . . auctor.- sc. Ennius-3 ‘than Ennius, the author
(writer) of a rude kind of poetry unknown to the Greeks? Auctor
cannot refer to Lucilius, the inventor of satire, as Heindorf and
others have supposed 3 as the passage, after the words sed ille, does
not agree with his character. Auctor means scriptor ,- and the
passage refers to Ennius. ,

72. Stylum vertas: i. e. invert the stylus to erase words with
the fiat end, so formed for the purpose of erasing, and smoothing
the wax on which they wrote.

75. Dictat-i .· i. e. be dictated by schoolmasters to their pupils in
petty schools. Before the art of printing was invented, as the
work of transcribing was slow, the copies of books were scarce3
and teachers read aloud to their scholars such passages as they
wished them to write down and committo memory:

76. Nam satis . . . dixit .· ‘it is sufficient for me if the knights
applaud, as said the bold Arbuscula, when hissed off the stage,
despising the rabble.’ She was a celebrated comedian.

78. Cimex .· ‘ disgusting.’

79. Absentem.- sc. me.

82.- Octavius.- this was an eminent poet and historiari. Au-
gustus had ceased to be called Octavius.

84. Ambitione relegata .· ‘ free from all arts to gain favor.’

88. Quibus . . . velim .· ‘ whom Ι hope these my writingS, such
as they are, may please.’

92. Puer .- ‘secretary3’ add this satire to what I have before
written on this subject.
