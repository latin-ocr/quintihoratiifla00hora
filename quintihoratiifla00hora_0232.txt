-ODE 1.

Asrmus Pomm, a soldier, a statesman, and a scholar, had also
distinguished himself as a tragic writer3 and had raised the renu—
tation of the Roman stage nearly to an equality with that of A‘th-
ens· But Pollio was engaged in a work better deserving his whole
strength and attention. This was a history of the civil wars, in
which he hadr already advanced considerably, when Horace, ap-
prehensive that the applause which Pollio received from the stage
might interrupt a history so interesting to the republic, wrote this
Ode to urge him to persevere. And at the same time he exhorts
Pollio not to be diverted from this object, he reminds him how deli-
cate and dangerous a task he had undertaken.

1. .Motum ex Metello .- the construction is, O Pollio, tractas civi-
cum motum ez· consule Metello, causasque belli, &c.

It was during the consulship of Metellus and Lucius Afranius,
that Caesar, Pompey and Crassus formed that confederacy com-
monly known by the name of the First Triumvirate. The poet
says, You treat of the civil commotioris which took place, begin-
mlgg Ἑῒυὲξξαίῗῃῗῳαεξτιίἷίῗίἓέξθῗἓῖλῗῇε coalition of the Triumvm‘,
so destructive to the liberty of the commonwealth.

6. Periculosae .· this might well be called ‘ a work full of danger-
ous chance‚' since the fidelity of the historian must be preserved,
without offending Augustus, or disobliging many families that had
been deeply engaged in the civil war, by opening afresh wounds
that were now nearly healed.

9. Musa tragoediae desit theatris .· i. e. relinquish for a time your
favorite pursuit, and abstain from writing tragedieS, till you have
put the finishing hand to a work of so much importance as that
in which you are engaged.

10. Mox . . . cothurno : ‘hereaster, when you shall have digest-
ed and arranged the events in your history, you shall resume the
noble employment of writing tragedy with true Athenian dig·
nit .

{he cothurnus, or buskin, was frequently put for tragedy, which
had at that time reached a greater degree of excellence at Athens
than at any other place.

From the expression publicas res ordinaris, many have supposed
Pollio was consul at the time this ode was written, and that this
sentence had reference to the management of public business.
