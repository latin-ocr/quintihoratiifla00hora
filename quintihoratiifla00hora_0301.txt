SATIRES. Book 1. 293

4. Dextra .· the image held a cane or club in its right hand, and
a crown or bunch of reeds was fastened on its head, which by
rattling srightened away the birds.

6. Novis: Maecenas had lately built a palace and laid out ex-
tensive gardens on the Esquiline Hm, formerly the common bury-
ing-ground for slaves and other poor.

7. Augustis . . . cellis.- the bodies of the poor were in times
past brought here from their narrow cells, or huts‚ by their fellow
slaves.

10. Pantolabo.- Pantolabus and Nomentanus were both still
living 3 but as they had squandered away their estates in dissipa-
tion, Horace appoints a burial-place for them with the lowest of
the rabble.

11. Cippus: when ground was set aside for any use, it was
customary for *the dimensions to be marked on a pillar set up, for ’
the purpose, on its margin. In this instance, the dimensions
marked on the cippus were one thousand feet in front and three
hundred in depth towards the field3 with the additional clause
that this ground should never rever-t to the heirs of the estate.

12. Haeredes . . . sequeretur .· ‘that this burying-ground should
never revert to the heirs of the estate)

14. Quo . . . agrum .- ‘from which, but lately, men beheld the
field deformed and white with human bones)

16. Quum . . . animos.- ‘although thieves and beasts of prey,
accustomed to infest this region, were not so vexatious to me as
those hags, who by their enchantments and poisons disturb the
minds of people.‘ After quantiam, understand veneficae sunt.
Priapus uses the present tense, although speaking of the state of
things on Esquiliae prior to the improvements recently made
by Maecenas3 or perhaps at the time of their commencement.

24. Cum Sagand majore.- ‘with Sagana the elder.’ There
were two sisters of this name.

30. Lanea: the image ‘of wool’ represented the person whom
the sorceresses favored3 that ‘of wax,’ the intended victim of the
charm. The waxen image melted, as indicative of their conquest
over the person it represented.

31. servilibus . . . modis .- ⁶ in a servile posture, and as if already
about to perish.’

36. Mentior at si quid: ‘but if Ι misrepresent anything)

38. Pediatia.- to express his contempt for the effeminacy of
Pediatius, Horace gives him the feminine gender.

41. Lupi. . . colubrae: ‘the hair of a wolf and the tooth of a
spotted snake)

44. Voces . . . duarum.- ‘at the words and actions of these two
Furies.’

46. Diffisdi the wood, not being perfectly dry, was split by
the beat of the fire with a loud crack, which frightened the
witcheS, and they ran off in great terror.
