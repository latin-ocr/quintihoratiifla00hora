ject in assuming it was to avenge the death of Caesar, and ω fiee
Rome from the calamities under which it was suffering. - >

The poet therefore avails himself of these incidents to address
Augustus, as the tutelary divinity of R01ne3 and, aster compliment-
ing him very delicately under the character of Mercury, exhorts
him to cherish the blessings of peace at home, and to defend the

⁷ Roman people from foreign foes.

6. Soeczdum Pyrrhae .· Pyrrha was the wife of Deucalion, king
of Thessaly, in whose time the deluge came. Pyrrha may well
be tho'ught to have complained of ‘ strange prodigies,' which the
Romans were apprehensive were about to be rencwed.

13. Flavum . . . undis .· Our word ‘ yellow’ but poorly expresses
the meaning offlavus, when applied to the Tiber at, or near to
Rome. This river is there deep, rapid, and exceedingly turbid,
from the quantities of sand and leam usually blended with its wa-
ter3 especially aster rains, which give it a tawny or muddy color;
its appearance is extremely unpoetic, and anything but ‘yellowss
About the first of J anuary, 1830, the Tiber rose fourteen feet in
twenty-fourhours 3 and when it subsided‚ the alluvial deposits along
the stone steps of the quay in Rome were from six to eight inches
deep. The predominant color of these deposits was nearly that of
halsldried clay3 and this is the prevailing color of the Tiber at
Rome.—Retortis .· ‘being driven back.’ The Tiber flows into the
Tuscan sea, but in this instance, being driven up by a violent tem-
pest against its current, already swollen by rains and snOW, it·
seemed to roll backwardS.—Littore Etrusco .· ‘from the shore of the
Tuscan sea? ,

15. Μοηωηεηία regis .· i. e. the monument of Numa Pompilius.

17. llice .· the construction is, dum amnis uxorius jactat Iliae,
nimium querenti, se fore ultorem necis Caesaris et vagus labitur ripd
sinistrci, Jove ‘non probante. Ilia, called also Rhea Silvia, was the
mother of Romulus She was thrown by Amulius into the Tiber,
or rather into the Anio, near where it empties into the Tiber, which
is therefore called her husband, and made to avenge her wrongs.
Ilia may be said to have carried her complaints concerning the
death of Caesar too far3 since they brought such destruction upon
Rome, which Jupiter, as its tutelary divinity, did not approve.

Doering considers nimium an adjective, agreeing with ultorem ;
“nimium non ad querenti, sed ad ultorem referendum esse puto}
nimius enim suit ultor Tiberis, sive modum in ulciscendo uxoris
suae dolore excessit, dum tantam ruinam Romae aedificiis molieba-
tur.” This certainly appears very consistent. ⁷

Rome was chiefly built on the left or eastern bank of the Tiber,
sinislrci ripci, which, being somewhat lower than the other, was pe·
culiarly exposed to the inundation.

23. Vitio parentiam : i. e. the youth would be few in number in x
consequence of the civi] wars in which their fathers engaged.

27. Minus audientem .· Vesta was displeased with the Romans,
on account of the death of Caesar, and of the civil wars in which

“ they engaged.
