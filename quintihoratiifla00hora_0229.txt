ODE XXIX.

In the year of Rome 726, Augustus enrolled two armies, intend-
ing to lead one of them in person against the Britons, and to send
the other, under AElius Gallus, into Arabia. Horace, ever ready to ,
express his gratitude and good will towards his friend and patron,
wrote this address to Fortune 3 invoking her aid towards a favora-
ble result of these expeditioris

When Augustus was actually on his march, intending to pass
through Gaul, and transport his army over to Britain, he was met
by an embassy from Britain, which accepted the terms he propos-
ed. He therefore gave up the expedition.

1. Antium .· this was a city of Italy, the capital of the Volscians.
It had a commodious harbor, and was a place of considerable im-
portance. There waS, in this city, a temple to Fortune, famous
for the splendid gists with which it was enriched, as well as for the
lots cast there, and the responses of its oracle. Fortune is there-
fore said to govern it.

2. Praesens .· i. e. ready and able.

12. Metuant : ⁴ reverence ; do homage to? ⁴

13. Iujurioso . . . frangat : ‘ that thou maye st not with violent foot
cast down the yet standing pillar of state3 and that a thronging
multitude may not excite the quiet citizens by crying, ‘⁴ To arms,
To arms,’' and thus overthrow the government.’ -

17. Saeva Necessitas .- this description is highly colored:
‘ Stern Necessity always precedes thee, bearing in her brazen
hand spikes and wedges.' The wedges were not to be used in
splitting, but in making more compact3 and the parts so compress-
ed, when of wood, were to be secur-ed by the long nails3 when of
stone, by iron hooks, or clamps‚ let in and fastened with melted
lead, liquidum plumbum. The uncus is not intended, as supposed
by some, for an instrument of punishment, but a clamp.

22. Nec comitem abnegat .· sc. se.

23. Utcunque mutata . . veste .· ⁴ however much you change your
dress! We may suppose prosperous fortune to be clad Splendidly,
and adverse fortune meanly.

29. Serves: i. e. may you attend Caesar on his march against
tiflhe Britona, and also the expedition about to be sent into the

33. OEcatricum . . .fi·atrum .· i. e. may we be ashamed of the
evils we have brought on ourselves by the civil wars, and dread a
repetition of Ιιῐιθιίᾈ·ιι
