ODE III.

Horace and Virgil were closely united by the bonds of affection
and friendship, as well as by similarity of taste and kinds-ed pur-
suits.

This ode was written on the embarkation of Virgil for Athens,
where he expected to meet the emperor, on his return from Asia.
Virgil had intended to accompany Augustus in 1115 eastern expe-
dition, but was prevented by ill health. He, however, met him at
Athens, but he was soon aster taken ill at Megara, and brought
back to Italy at his own request, and lauded at Brundusium3
where he died a few days after. So that this was in fact Horace's
farewell address to his friend. He expresses great interest and
feeling 011 1110 occasion, and even goes so far as to execrate the
invention of ships, and to call the· art of navigation impious, as vio-
lating the intention of 1110 gods,

2. Fratres Helenae· . Castor and Pollux, sons of Leda.

3. Ventorum. .Ραεεν. · i. e. AEolus, whom Homer represents as
confining the winds ln a bag, and Virgil as confining them 111 a cave.

4. Iapyga.- The Icipyx was a westerly wind, and the most fa-
vorable for those sailing from Italy to Athens. It was so called
from Iapyges, the inhabitants of Apulia, from which this wind blew
towards AthenS.

7. Reddas .· sc. ut. This passage may be rendered thus : ‘O ship,
that owest to the shores of Attica Virgfl, intrusted to thee, Ι pray
that the queen of CypruS, the bright stars, Castor and Pollux, and
the sov ereign of the winds, restra1 ung all but the Iapyx, may 50
direct you, that you may deliver him ln safety’

14. Hyadas: The H fades are a constellation at the head of the
Bull, commonly known by the name of the Seven Stars. They
are called tristes, because their rising and setting are fiequiently
attended with rain.

18. Monstra natantia.- ‘the hideous monsters of the deep swim-
ming around him? The ancients feared above all things a death
which deprived them of a burial3 as in that case they were not per·
mitted to pass the Styx, and 110 at rest, for a hundred years.

20. Acroceraunia.- from cino ‘the summit? and κε ενραυ ὸς ‘thun-
(101·’;ει high promontory in Epirus, between the Adriatic and the
Ionidn sea, whose summit was osten struck with thunder3 called
mames, because Augustus came near being shipwrecked there.
