merly a brave and virtuous people, that they cultivated the1r landa

ODE VII.

A festival was observed with much religious pomp by the Ro-
man ladies on the first of March, in memory of the day on which
the Sabine women reconciled and made peace between the Sa-
bines and their husbands, who had seized them. On this day, too,
they had dedicated a temple to J uno, in which they annually of-
fered sacrifices to that goddess. While the ladies were engaged
in their offerings to J uno, their husbands sacrificed to J anus. Af-
ter these religious services were over, the ladies received pres-
ents from their husbands and other friends, as an acknowledg-
ment of the favor conferred by their happy mediation. The Ca-
lends of March were called Matronalia, or Matronales Feriae.

We may suppose that MaecenaS, in a visit to the poet early on
the Calends· of March, had expressed some surprise at finding him
employed in pregairgtions for a domestic feast, as Horace was not.
